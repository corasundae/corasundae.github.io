Turning around would only slow you down, so you keep running to where it's safe. You trip a few times in something slippery but you make it.\n\nAll the guys are in a circle in an area lit by a pool of moonlight like silibrium. You can't make out anyone's face.\n\nMarch repeats, &quot;There's a traitor among us. Who is it?&quot; You have the feeling everyone is looking at you, but the shadows cast on their faces make them all seem unsympathetic.\n\n&quot;The traitor is...&quot; Every second you hesitate, one of them is stabbed.You take too long and the searing pain of a knife in the back is all you feel before you wake up.\n\nYou're sweating and thinking to yourself what an awful and stupid dream that was. Lonnie and Chess are kneeling in front of you, looking concerned. \n\n&quot;Bad dream?&quot; Lonnie asks.\n\n&quot;No duh,&quot; you reply. &quot;What time is it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nine,&quot; Chess answers.\n\n&quot;So the fake silibrium should've been delivered by now,&quot; you muse. &quot;Everything's going according to plan,&quot; you say and try to smile at Chess. He doesn't even attempt to return it. His expression more worried than you've ever seen it. \n\n[[Outskirts of Eba]]</div><div tiddler="Find out more" tags="" created="201306180256" modifier="twee" twine-position="936,161">&quot;When?&quot; you ask. Sophie says it was a year ago but she doesn't really like talking about because it's still fresh in her mind. You wanna ask her what happened but you think that would be taking it too far. \n\nWell, it's getting late, you tell her, so you'll see her in the morning. She says good night.\n\n[[Vacuuming]]</div><div tiddler="Working with Madison again" tags="" created="201407132239" modifier="twee" twine-position="1681,2194">It's almost dinnertime and all the dishes for the last meal have been washed. Since you only wash for breakfast and lunch, all the work for the day is pretty much done. Theo comes by and takes one of the appetizers that Madison just made. He asks if you knew that one of the old seers is getting sentenced? You said no. Why? He says that his predictions have been inaccurate or untrue lately, and now the old man was just saying things the Queen didn't want to hear. As he gestures animatedly, you notice his hands are shaking a little and a bead of sweat rolls down his face. You ask him if he's okay. &quot;Well, that seer was obviously off his rocker but I'm more worried about the fact that you can get kicked out just for predicting something the Queen doesn't like. I mean, some of the older seers were always saying that you can't run to the Queen over every vision, but...&quot;\n\n&quot;What did he predict?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don't know exactly since the queen made sure that the words were not repeated by threatening beheading. But it must have been bad.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do you know him?&quot;\n\nHe hesitates, &quot;We seers, we all know each other. Usually people view being a Seer as a blessing. Coming a from a poor family having this ability has really changed things for the better. My siblings were able to go to good schools. My mother can hold her head high. Here at the palace the Queen leaves us be for the most part. But often times it's almost a curse. We see a lot of things.&quot; His eyes slightly glaze over as he recounts the dark side of being a seer. &quot;It gets scary. So we stick together. You ask me if I know him. We are one in the same.&quot;\n\nYou don't what to say. You follow him out into the corridor. He leads you to a place in the castle that you've never seen before. There is a darker skinned fellow waiting there. Theo refers to him as Kota. He is standing there with an old man wearing the same robes as Theo (though in shabbier condition). Theo hands him a bag with the appetizers from earlier. Kota eyes you nervously but Theo lets him know that you're safe. He gives the Seer a big hug and tells him to never come back and to take care of himself. You look at the seer closely and see that he's mostly just gazing into space until suddenly he's staring at you very strangely, like he knows you. It makes you uncomfortable because you have never seen him before. But the way he's looking at you is like he's looking at an old friend. One that he's angry with. He tells you that you're late. You're confused. Late for what? Finally he tells you that you have your mother's eyes. How would he know what your mother looked like? He then says some other weird stuff and you realize the man must be nuts. \n\nYou head home. At home you think about how there are people who apparently can see into the future? Or think they can. In books you read, people who get transported into different worlds sometimes have hidden powers they only discover when they get there. Maybe that applies to you too?\n\n[[Make your desk lamp levitate]]\n[[Go to bed]]</div><div tiddler="No way in hell." tags="" created="201301072241" modifier="twee" twine-position="375,1733">You tell Elai there's no way in hell you're going to help her. Elai agrees but Anang overhears and begs you two to go along with this one thing. You and Elai look at each other but nod anyway.\n\n[[It's a deal]]</div><div tiddler="Go just outside Anang's house" tags="" created="201212311305" modifier="twee" twine-position="347,403">You meet Anang's mom, who is outside in the garden humming as she works. You greet Anang's mom, who tells you to call her by her first name, which is Aura. Her mom observes that Anang isn't in the best of moods today. You explain that she is disappointed because you cannot train her. Anang's mom is like, &quot;Oh, Anang... she still wants to be a warrior...&quot; She complains that Anang refuses to color her hair and that Anang wears her hair plain white like a warrior. You ask her why the village even needs warriors. Is there a war going on? Anang's mother suddenly looks very suspicious and gives a half hearted response about how sometimes its best for certain people to be seperated from each other. You want to inquire further but you can tell she doesn't want to say anymore. So you smile and head off somewhere else.\n\nAs you head off somewhere else, you bump into a tall, buff man just in front of the house. &quot;Another day at Gold's Gym,&quot; he explains, breathlessly. &quot;Day three of detox, only raw fruits and veggies. Down from 216 pounds to 209, I believe mainly due to water weight and gut weighed food down.&quot; You ask him if he is Anang's brother. &quot;Sleep then gym in the morning,&quot; he replies, wiping the sweat from his brow. You ask him where he was today. He responds, &quot;I may be the only person not drinking liquor on new year's eve.&quot; You leave.\n\n&lt;&lt;set $AnangsMom = true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;Morning actions&quot;&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Grabbing Lonnie's hand" tags="" created="201307062159" modifier="twee" twine-position="1215,2087">Lonnie is climbing on to the table but you grab him by the wrist.\n\n&quot;Lonnie, wait--&quot;\n\n&quot;Sorry, Allison,&quot; he mumbles with an apologetic smile. &quot;We knew we couldn't stay in one place forever. We can't... Even though I want...&quot;\n\nChess is looking at Lonnie expectantly, you realize. Lonnie realizes this, too. He gives you a quick hug, says &quot;Later, Allison,&quot; and starts climbing again. He climbs out the window and Chess follows after him.\n\n[[After they've left]]</div><div tiddler="We're out for a stroll." tags="" created="201306230304" modifier="twee" twine-position="1057,1126">You tell the soldiers you're just out for a stroll and indignantly interlace your fingers with Chess's. He's shocked and embarrassed. &quot;That's not...&quot; he starts. \n\nThe soldier who was quiet before remarks that young love is beautiful and that they should leave you be. The first soldier is taken aback that anyone could fall for something like that so easily. The second soldier says hasn't /he/ ever taken a young lady out on a night stroll? The first soldier, stuttering, agrees that maybe he has. But that doesn't mean he can't check these people anyway. As a soldier on patrol it's his duty. You and Chess glance at each other. They seem a little incompetent.\n\n[[Getting away with Chess]]</div><div tiddler="The traitor is Lonnie" tags="" created="201401200056" modifier="twee" twine-position="597,6178">Lonnie's path:\n\n&quot;Me?&quot; Lonnie's expression was a mix of hurt and confusion. \n\n&quot;Uh, I was just kidding.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, this isn't the time to joke, Allison,&quot; he says, putting an extra helping of bitterness into your name.\n\nOther:\n\n&quot;Me?&quot; Lonnie looked indignant. &quot;And where's your proof?&quot;\n\n&quot;You and Chess keep sneaking around and talking where none of us can hear you.&quot; \n\n&quot;We're not sneaking around!&quot;\n\n[[Going nowhere fast]]</div><div tiddler="Call for help" tags="" created="201601060325" modifier="twee" twine-position="1694,2817">You call for help, saying you're in serious pain. Madison comes in in night clothes and asks what happened. You respond simply, &quot;my stomach is killing me. I don't think I'll be able to go to work today, sorry...&quot;\n\n&quot;Last night's food?&quot; he suggests. &quot;But March and I were fine... not that I think your food could cause food poisoning or anything along those lines.&quot;\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n&quot;One of my appetizers?&quot;\n\n&quot;Um... it's definitely not that.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then what could it possibly--oh.&quot; It looks like cogs are turning in his brain. &quot;Ohh. I'll... be back.&quot;\n\nYou sit alone in your misery. Now not only are you dying but Madison is fully aware that you bleed out of your vagina. You roll over in pain and sob, mostly about the second part.\n\nMadison comes back and sees you crying. &quot;Is the pain worse?&quot;\n\n&quot;Noo...&quot; you sob.\n\n&quot;A package for one Miss Allison,&quot; he says, and places something on your back. You roll over and it falls to your side. A bag of pads. &quot;Hopefully, it'll be a sight for sore eyes, among other things.&quot;\n\n&quot;Uh, thanks. Really.&quot; This is the most sincere apology you could muster with the amount of pain you're in. Also, is he talking about your uterus or...?\n\n&quot;We really should do something about that pain, shouldn't we?&quot; he says with a smile. \n\n&quot;Yeah. We should.&quot;\n\n&quot;Does this mean you have to walk away again?&quot;\n\nHe laughs a little. &quot;It won't be long this time.&quot;\n\nHe leaves and after a while you hear sounds coming from that room that you couldn't go in. He comes back with a drink. You're about to take it from and he gently chides you, pulling it back. &quot;Not for drinking. Breathe in.&quot;\n\nYou take a strong whiff of the bottle. It smells... interesting. Like citrus and vanilla with some pungent sour base note.\n\nYou feel a little relaxed by it. Then he hands you a mug. &quot;Now this is for drinking.&quot; You take it in your hands and drinking it. Caramel chai tea, essentially. But it's a bit whiter and milkier than usual, almost powdery. You raise an eyebrow but drink it slowly. &quot;Make sure you finish that, then get some rest. I'll tell them you can't come.&quot; He leaves.\n\nYou take care of feminine hygiene business. After a while, the pain subsides just enough for you to fall asleep.\n\nWhen you wake up, the pain is almost completely gone. It's the late afternoon but you can move around and walk now, so you do. You find Madison in the kitchen, eating a delicious looking sandwich. Something is in the oven. Guess he didn't go to work.\n\nYou ask him how he knows to make that. &quot;Chai tea? I learned it from you.&quot; \nYou shake your head. &quot;No, the powdery stuff.&quot; He mentions that he makes it for his mother all the time and that that's the only reason she visits him anymore. He chuckles.\n\n&quot;I wonder how my mother's doing. This place is so strange.&quot;\n\n&quot;This place?&quot;\n\n&quot;Wonderland.&quot;\n\nHe sees your eyes stuck to the sandwich and stands up. &quot;You know, when I was a child, I had a dream about being in another world. I've always been a little strange, and I was used to vivid dreams, anyway. This was just another one. I met a little girl my own age. Those dreams, they were... fun. I suppose they were my escape from the pressures of overbearing parental expectation.&quot; He's made you a sandwich, too. &quot;I don't dream much anymore.&quot;\n\n&quot;So, I think I might be able to go to work tomorrow. Well, probably. I don't know how long that stuff you made'll last.&quot;\n\n&quot;Don't worry, I'll give you more first thing in the morning.&quot;\n\n&quot;Really, what was that?&quot;\n\nHe shrugs and says, &quot;My specialty.&quot; You raise an eyebrow but he doesn't say anything else. So he's a chef who can also... do medicine? You don't understand but he doesn't seem willing to talk about it anymore. You head back to your room and get some rest.\n\n[[Another work day]]</div><div tiddler="Iron Jeff" tags="" created="201605130349" modifier="twee" twine-position="1740,3810">You look up at the sky. It's, fortunately, clear of clouds. The Queen sits on a platform at a small table, Madison at her side. \n\nMadison gives you an apprehensive look. He seems nervous about this whole idea and you can kind of understand why. The queen is nuts. But how nuts can she really be? Its a cooking competition. There will be desserts. The way the competition is set up each representative from top culinary schools across Wonderland must create a desert with a hidden mystery ingredient incorporated. At the end after all the food is tasted the mystery ingredients are revealed. They are different food items like pumpkin and brocolli. Things typically not foundin deserts. During the final presentation of the delicacies some hidden ingredients are quite obvious while others are inconspicious. You stand off to the side trying not to get in the way. Madison didnt even want you there but you fought your way in. The queen, who is beautiful but a little vacant in the eyes, oohs and aahs at each of the different deserts before she tries them. She seems to like each one after tasting them and claps in surprise when she finds out what the secret ingredients are. She gets to the last contestant and all is looking good. She's in good spirits. You flash Madison a grin and thumbs up. You think you've got her.\n\nShe takes one bite out of the cupcake and chews it deliciously. She makes a joke and asks the cook what the mystery ingredient was as she'd done before with all the other contestants. But upon hearing that the ingredient is tomatoes she drops the cupcake to the floor and stares straight ahead as though stricken. One of her advisors runs up to her and asks what happened. She hates tomatoes. Since when the seer asks her. The look she gave him could have melted ice. The hall was silent.This was a surprise, Madison had been careful to make sure that only foods and colors the queen liked were included. You knew for a fact that she'd had tomatoes in her sandwich during lunch time. The queen goes ballistic and has everyone in the room executed.\n\n[[Duck into the shadows]]\n[[Confront her about how ridiculous she's being.]]</div><div tiddler="Chess's path start" tags="" created="201706281603" modifier="twee" twine-position="2549,7019"></div><div tiddler="Over before it started" tags="" created="201306100149" modifier="twee" twine-position="335,3226">The next day Chardon has come to get you and tells you the  the tree bridge has been burnt down. You and her go to look at it and it turns out it's true. She tells you that someone found Anang bringing over the Chiquay generator and her justification didn't go over well and the whole plan's been ruined. Katori's not allowed to leave her house. \n\nThis comes at a terrible time because it is when you were supposed to cross the bridge again because allegedly his brother would be in town and he would be able to answer more of your questions.\n\nThe Chief calls you again to talk about things. This time you can sense that you're in trouble. He was suspicious of you from the time that you came. He accuses you of being a spy from Wonderland from the Queen. He mentions something about a treaty and being a sovereign entity that is seperate from Terravius. You tell him you have no idea what he's talking about. For some reason he chooses to believe you muttering like (Yes, yes, of course. Now that he thought about it why would the Queen have a skinny little nobody like you as a spy).\n\nBut he does give you an ultimatum. He says that since people in the village have grown to like you (especially members of the council) he can't just kick you out but if it were up to him you'd be out of there. So he tells you that if you're going to stay that you better stay in line and to never go back to the Chiquay side. You ask him if he was the one who burned down the tree bridge. He says yes and threatens you and tells you that if you won't be able to heed his warning then you should leave now and never come back. The choice is yours. But the way he said that stuck out to you. He's telling you not to go back to the Chiquay side... so there must be another way across.\n\n[[So there's another way across?]]\n[[I promise I'll stay in line from now on.]]\n\n</div><div tiddler="The flammable silibrium (Madison)" tags="" created="201401200159" modifier="twee" twine-position="878,6310">&quot;The flammable silibrium,&quot; you say definitively. &quot;According to the plan, it was supposed to be non-flammable so it wouldn't combust when they tried to use it, right?&quot;\n\nMarch stops you. &quot;First of all, I was the one who made the silibrium. Second of all, yeah, I screwed up but does it matter? It wouldn't work as a fuel either way because it's not silibrium. Can you power a car by pouring matches into its fuel tank? Those are flammable.&quot;\n\nHe's right. But... dammit! You know Madison's guilty. You've never been this sure of anything! You just don't know how! Your stomach turns with the anxiety. Why don't you have the proof?\n\n[[Going nowhere fast]]</div><div tiddler="Tying Madison up" tags="" created="201401200255" modifier="twee" twine-position="1032,6733"> In seconds, Chess has Madison in a strong grip. Lonnie helps tie him up. But nobody's quite sure what to do with him. Elai and Anang uselessly suggest letting him stay there to starve, but you argue that it would be inhumane. So you... take him with you?\n\n&quot;Can't have him running back to the Queen now,&quot; Chess says.\n\nSo they interrogate Madison and ask him how much does the Queen know and what would the repercussions of him not reporting back on schedule be. Madison is of course being difficult but you start to pick up that, while he's bitter, he's not doing any of this out of allegiance to the Queen. March cuts in and says he can't believe Madison did this and how could he not have known? \n\nMadison says, &quot;You've always been inobservant, haven't you?\n\nYour plan would've failed anyway whether I had a part in it or not. Don't you realized how closely guarded the Queen is? She doesn't even use the same deliverymen twice. You would've never made it in the castle.&quot;\n\nHe then goes back to being completely useless on the matter, so you, Chess, and Lonnie end your interrogation.\n\nKota asks what to do with him and you suggest waiting till nighttime to bring him to Sophie. Carrying him around on the actual mission would be suicide, but you're not gonna kill him or let him starve either. Madison looks annoyed but is quiet. Everyone just stays in the forest for the next few hours. You think over what Madison said. Madison fell asleep and woke up now. You tentatively tap him on the shoulder and ask him about why he said that. Why'd he let you guys have that one hint? You don't know what it means yet but... you know he's not stupid so it couldn't have been an accident.\n\nMadison is silent.\n\nMadison's path:\n\t&quot;I don't know what I was thinking. I suppose... that I wanted to share everything with you and I got carried away... perhaps that's half of it. And the other half...&quot; he takes a deep breath. &quot;I don't want you to get hurt. Not if I can ever prevent it.&quot;\n\nYou hug him tightly. You don't want to let him go. Not now or ever. At some point, you realize your tears are wetting his shirt.\n\nMarch walks by. &quot;So you're still all over him even now, huh?&quot; he says, cracking a weak smile. &quot;We're gonna have to leave now. I'm taking him somewhere safe, don't worry.&quot;\n\nOther:\nYou hug him. &quot;Maybe we're friends,&quot; you posit. &quot;You trust me. Maybe you even trust all of us. You care more about us than you do about the Queen and even if you don't particularly care about our mission, you don't want us to die.&quot;\n\nGiving no indication that he heard anything you said, he says icily, &quot;If my hands weren't bound, you would have a knife in your back right now.&quot;\n\nThat startles you a little but you try to hide it and let go slowly. &quot;Suuure,&quot; you say so he might think you don't believe him. Although you're not sure. \n\nSo March knocks Madison out and leaves with him to go to Sophie.\n\n</div><div tiddler="On and on" tags="" created="201301050126" modifier="twee" twine-position="295,1409">You start to go to see Elai more and more, trying to find ways to trigger your memory. During one of these visits, he shows you the old ampitheater that the Hautain and Chiquay used to meet at. He is trying to fix it up because he thinks it could look really cool and be useful but it looks kinda dumb to you right now. \n\nAnang sends you to go get a certain type of red plant, by the river again. You don't see any of it on this side but you know you saw something like it on the way to Elai's town square. You finish crossing the tree bridge when Anang comes out from behind a bush or something and says &quot;Gotcha! That berry only grows on the Chiquay side of the river! I knew you had to be crossing bridges!&quot; You, offended, tell her that it's not like she told you not to. Is it a crime? Then, wide-eyed, Anang says... &quot;Can I come with?&quot; Not surprised in the least, you help her across.\n\nWhen Elai sees her, he gets really upset about it. Anang gets really upset at him. Both start insulting each other. Anang lunges for Elai. You have to break them up. &quot;Do you guys even know what you're fighting for? Do you guys understand why you don't like each other? Because I certainly don't!&quot; Anang complains that she knows his people used many of hers as human sacrifices. Elai grumbles that she's making crap up, as typical of a Hautain, and that her people had stolen every individual brick from the house of the orphanage. He bets her people would steal the clothes right off someone's back. Allison tells them both to be quiet and realize what they're saying sounds dumb. Allison asks Elai if his people have ever performed human sacrifice. He vehemently disagrees. She asks Anang if her people have ever taken bricks. &quot;Of course not! Why would we need your bricks--&quot; &quot;Well, there you have it.&quot; She says nice things about Elai and nice things about Anang and says maybe the two could help each other and possibly even become friends. Both of them scoff at the remark. You tell Anang about how Elai is trying to fix up the amphitheater and she immediately takes interest, though Elai gets annoyed with you for sharing this. She asks to see it and you take her, ignoring Elai's glares all the way. When Anang sees it, she says it's okay but it could be a lot better. She says it has a few important crops but a lot of other stuff is missing. Incidentally, it's all stuff only grown on her side of the river. Anyway, she says she will help fix it up, so he should be grateful. \n\n[[Apprentice 2: Return of the Desperate]]</div><div tiddler="In the Warehouse (Chess)" tags="" created="201308241919" modifier="twee" twine-position="1200,2985">You look up and see Lonnie, who's looking rather content with himself, but is trying to hide it. Chess behind him is in an offensive stance but then he looks at you. He drops his arms, his face a stone cold mask. A little further away is the guy who delivered the message, wearing a benign confused expression. Next to him is another guy a little shorter than Chess, whom you've never seen before (looking shocked, annoyed, and a little guilty all at once). You get the immediate impression that, despite his flamboyant taste in fashion, he is an adult, though he can't be much older than the others. It doesn't take long for them to figure out you're not a threat, so their eyes slowly turn to Chess whose expression remains unreadable. You're more than a little unsettled. He hates you, and with good reason. You're getting in the way. He never really liked you and now you've gone and made it worse.\n\n&quot;The note, right?&quot; Lonnie says with a self-satisfied smile. \n\nChess doesn't look at him but says evenly, &quot;It may be hard for you to comprehend, but in sending that letter, you've endangered all of us. I expected more from you.&quot; Chess looks at him. &quot;We can defend ourselves. Allison, who doesn't have anything to do with this, can't, and now you've dragged her into this. The last thing we need is another person to worry about.&quot; Finally, Chess looks at you. You weren't prepared for that. &quot;Why did you come?&quot; he says flatly.\n\n[[I was worried about you guys]]\n[[I needed to see you]]\n[[It was getting boring around the inn]]</div><div tiddler="Stay put v2" tags="" created="201706280422" modifier="twee" twine-position="2186,5208">You don't dare move. You stay in one place as the conversation grows more and more audible. Finally, you can make out some words. Madison's shouting.\n\n&quot;This is what you wanted all along!&quot;\n\n&quot;I cannot believe you. I've been your friend when you've had no one else. To believe I could be that conniving...Do we even know each other at all?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don't know, do we?&quot;\n\nYou hear the sound of someone stomping away.\n\n[[Go to sleep v2]]\n[[Go outside v2]]</div><div tiddler="Kota's return" tags="" created="201307060450" modifier="twee" twine-position="1060,1907">The day that Kota said he would return for his answer has come. You've been nervously anticipating his arrival. Ever since you gave Chess and Lonnie that motivational 'speech' a couple of days before, they'd been spending more time off by themselves in the basement. You kind of missed them making fun of you while you did your chores around the inn. Even Sophie had noticed a change in them and had let them off a little easier than usual. But that just meant more work for you. Not that you were complaining...well, not that much, anyway.\n\nYou remember feeling really passionate while you were giving the speech but you chopped it all up to adrenaline and couldn't remember half of what you had said. But whatever it was must have been some good stuff by the way the boys reacted.\n\nYou were at the front of the inn dusting out the common area rugs when you saw the Kota guy walking on up. He greeted you with a big smile. He had this father-like feel about him though you could see that he was not old enough to be anyone's dad, let alone yours.\n\n&quot;Got some good news for me?&quot; he asked you with a wink.\n\n&quot;I'm not sure, you'll have to find out for yourself,&quot; you tell him.\n\nYou lead him into the inn and down into the basement where Lonnie and Chess have locked themselves up for the evening. The basement lighting has improved significantly and the room no longer smelled of self-pity. You noticed they cleaned up a bit. The bottle of alcohol was no where to be seen... Nevermind, you see it on a shelf in the corner. But, well, it was still an improvement.\n\nChess and Lonnie look up as you guys enter. Lonnie smiles a thin lipped smile at Kota while Chess barely nods.\n\nThey guys immediately start to talk business. You guess some kind of imperceptible exchange occured because it was all rebellion talk. You feel your timid feet slowly moving in the direction of the stairs but your nosy ears want you to stay. They hadn't explicitly told you to stay but they hadn't exactly kicked you out either.\n\nWelp, that was all you needed. You stayed in the basement and hovered dangerously close to them as you tried to understand what exactly was going on. The exchanges were so quick and curt it was hard to really follow.\n\n&quot;Should we evacuate Eba?&quot; Lonnie asks.\n\nEba! You knew what that was. That forest place Kota mentioned! You found out it was by the ocean on your own a few days ago, looking at a map. Maybe that was the forest you came by when you got here.\n\n&quot;No, it would cause panic amongst the tribes. Besides, it looks like the Hautain and the Chiquay have too much pride to just allow Eba to be taken like that. But with the Queen's military power they'd be wiped out immediately,&quot; Chess says.\n\nKota sighs, &quot;I just can't imagine keeping something like this from them. If they can save themselves--&quot;\n\n&quot;We can't think short-term!&quot; Chess interjects, &quot;We have to think about the future, a future without the Queen of Hearts. I say storm into the castle and kill them all.&quot;\n\n&quot;You and what army? You, Lonnie, me, and our little mascot over here?&quot;\n\nI froze, he was talking about me. I felt like I'd been caught stealing the last cookie out of the cookie jar. They all turned to stare at me before continuing.\n\n&quot;Of course not, that would be a suicide mission.&quot; Kota answered himself. &quot;We need more people.&quot;\n\n&quot;Not too many because then word would get out and we'd definitely be caught,&quot; Lonnie quickly added.\n\nChess stared down at his hands. &quot;It's going to be difficult. The Queen... she's ruthless. We've seen this firsthand. Nearly everyone in Wonderland is afraid.&quot;\n\n&quot;It's because she's so unpredictable and the people are like sheep. Tomorrow morning she can announce that all right handed people be beheaded and by dusk we'd have a pile of bodies in town square.&quot;\n\nA grim atmosphere settled in the room. Since you'd been in Wonderland the things she'd decreed had been very tame like the banning of all things white in public and making it illegal to hum or whistle within 100 yards of city limit. But the way the guys spoke of her made you realize that those things were just the cusp of what she was capable of.\n\n&quot;This is why we have to rebel. Our actions will start a wave of change. I have a plan of sorts.&quot; Kota's expression was calm but serious as he said this. &quot;First things first get rid of all this alcohol. If we're going to do this we have to do this in our right state of mind.&quot;\n\nLonnie and Chess let out a small protest as Kota takes the bottle and smashes it against the wall. Luckily it's empty. You think that it was a little uncalled for and even Kota seems surprised at himself.\n\n&quot;No more meeting in bars!&quot; Kota commands. &quot;I don't know why you thought you'd find help there.&quot;\n\n&quot;If you think you're so great why don't you try recruiting some unfortunate souls for the cause. I'm sure they'll be frothing at the mouth now that someone like you is involved.&quot;\n\nKota nods enthusiastically completely missing Chess's sarcasm.&quot;I've been trying to find more people who I trust to join the rebellion.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good luck,&quot; says Lonnie but you can tell he doesn't really mean it.\n\nThey move on to talking about tactics, and you realize you should've probably left right after you were called a mascot, so you do so now.\n\nAbout a week and a half later Kota comes back with news. He's really  excited and he tells you all that he has convinced his old diplomat friend Madison to join. And it looks like Madison's friend, March, also wants to join. The rebellion looks like it's finally coming along. Kota mentions that now they've got somewhere they can use as a proper meeting place as well. He gives Lonnie a piece of paper that presumably has the address on it.\n\n&quot;I'm going home to check on my family back in Eba. I have a younger brother there. I think he should at least be informed about what's going on in Terovius. As a show of respect I try not to keep things from him. I'll be back in a few days. Try to stay out of trouble until I get back.&quot;\n\nTwo days later, Rufus (now donning new blue glasses) and four other men in military uniforms come to the inn and you know they haven't come as guests. You try to ignore him at first and face away so he can't see you good. This doesn't work for very long. He asks you if he could see your manager. You focus very hard on your task, which is polishing the tables. You say that she is busy right now but Rufus cuts you off and says that it is imperative that he speak to her. He smiles in a way that suggests that you better cooperate. You don't really know what else to do, so you go find Sophie and tell her that some soldiers are there. She looks troubled by this and she follows you back to Rufus. By the time she gets there, her face is steely again. Rufus informs Sophie that he and his men are conducting a search and asks if she has seen either of these men, and shows her pictures of Chess and Lonnie. Sophie calmly says no. Rufus says, &quot;Are you sure? Then you wouldn't mind us taking a look around.&quot; Sophie looks irritated immediately and says she has a business to run here. Rufus says he apologizes and they'll try not to make a mess of things. Sophie gives you a meaningful look and then quickly starts stalling, telling them to stop making a scene and saying that they have no respect. \n\nRight, you need to go warn the guys that there's trouble. You find them hanging around in the kitchen and you tell them that that Rufus guy is here and it looks like he wants them. Lonnie repeats &quot;Rufus?&quot; and Chess tells him now is not the time. They head down to the cellar, and you follow. They are tearing up the papers into nothing and cleaning off the drawing board quickly. You watch, amazed. Chess explains that if Rufus is here for them, things will be a lot harder on them if he finds out there's a rebellion, too. They throw some of the stuff into bags, like clothes and toiletries. Suddenly Lonnie asking frantically where the picture is. Of... You immediately pick up that it's Noemie's picture. Chess says there's no time to find that right now. You look on the ground and try to find it but it's not where it was before. Lonnie looks back and forth rapidly before letting out a frustrated sound.\n\nChess and Lonnie start to head back up the stairs but you can hear noise beyond the door. You say quietly that Rufus and his men have gotten past Sophie. Chess and Lonnie step away from the door in fear. They start pulling up a table to the high window to the outside. A bush is obscuring a window on the outside. They pile a chair onto it.\n\n[[Grabbing Chess's hand]]\n[[Grabbing Lonnie's hand]]</div><div tiddler="Reserved Allison: Talk to Camille" tags="" created="201605130202" modifier="twee" twine-position="1819,3657">You sit down next to Camille and try to make conversation but she's pouting, forlornly gazing at March talking to the blonde guy. You offer to buy her a drink and she considers refusing but accepts. She drinks in silence but looks thankful, but a little ashamed, turning her head away when she's done. You buy her another, and then another, and then she breaks down like a sad drunk. You pat her on the back and mumble soothing &quot;there, there&quot;s. She says she is in love with him. It turns out that she is actually a poor girl named Milly who just wants to marry into money, though she really does like March. (She left home because she didn't want to be a burden on her family and she wanted to make something of herself so she came to the city.) \n\nTo make money, Camille has been working as a hostess. But these days, blonde princess-types are not in demand anymore, so she is making less money and has to receive an allowance from her parents to pay her rent, which makes her want to put her plan to get married into overdrive.\n\nYou feel bad for her and tell her you will cheer her on.\n\n[[Iron Jeff]]</div><div tiddler="Ask to sleep on him again" tags="" created="201706280501" modifier="twee" twine-position="1983,5833">&quot;Then, is it okay if I... um... pick a more comfortable spot?&quot;\n\nYou both are shocked by your forwardness.

You get the point though. It would be a bit awkward if anyone woke up to see such a sight.\n\nHe leaves and comes back with a couple of sacks. He lays down on them. Hesitantly, you place your head on his belly. He's soft and warm. &quot;Good night,&quot; you say.\n\n&quot;Good night, Allison.&quot;\n\n\n[[A midsummer night's dream]]</div><div tiddler="It's all we can do, right?" tags="" created="201301072239" modifier="twee" twine-position="233,1729">You say that you have no choice, really.

It is quite evident that you've made a mess of things. He says that you're a bit dramatic. When you say abused you mean that you're parents are very unsupportive of you and your dreams. Something that he can relate to he says pointedly at them.They ask you what your dreams are and you once again falter. Madison says its to be a chef. This obviously upsets his parents. You have the sneaking suspicioun he is using you as a ploy to get them all riled up. He politely declares that he is done with dinner and asks to be excused without waiting for a reply.\n\nIf you lie:\n\nAfter he leaves everything gets really awkward. March makes a joke to change the mood but even he isn't into it anymore. The parents finally leave not really giving you a second glance. This leaves you alone with March. &quot;That was quite the tale you told&quot; You feel incredibly dumb for lying &quot;I know. I'm sorry. I don't know why I did it.&quot; &quot;Things come apart so easily when they have been held together with lies.&quot; He says with a grin. He's smiling but it feels like a warning.\n\n[[A weird riddle]]</div><div tiddler="Ask about the rebellion" tags="" created="201307010235" modifier="twee" twine-position="1144,1584">&quot;So there's a rebellion?&quot; He said that's what he heard. He said he had to ask around quite a few places before someone finally told him where he could find those guys. But it looks like the rebellion was just a joke. He says this with a sad sort of smile. He was hoping there'd be someone he could fight with, so that he could save his family and his home. Even if he got his younger brother out of Eba, there'd still be everyone else to worry about. And the Hautain probably wouldn't know what hit them.\n\nYou think he wants a sympathetic or understanding or grave look in response. Unfortunately, all you can do is show a very confused face. &quot;Is Eba a place, then?&quot; He gives you a blank look. &quot;It's a like a building, right...? An apartment complex...? A community? A city?&quot;\n\nHe smiles. You get the feeling that this is a smile of resignation. He explains that Eba is a self-governed territory occupied by the Chiquay and Hautain tribes. He says that it neighbors Wonderland and you tell him to hold up. &quot;Wonderland?&quot; You don't want to offend him but this is silly. So instead, you cautiously ask &quot;And this is Wonderland?&quot; Kota looks at you with disbelief and asks you how you managed to get to a country--an island--without knowing its name. Then he says, yes, this is Wonderland. \n\nYou want to be the one in disbelief. Because it is still totally silly that he's suggesting you're in a place called Wonderland. That's kids stuff. Fantasy stuff. But you know it matches up. Well, not totally, but it certainly would explain the old-timey backwardness. Or &quot;quaintness&quot;, more nicely put. \n\nKota sees you thinking a lot. You respond that you're sorry, you were thrown for a loop.  You say, &quot;So the Queen wants to take Eba's silibrium. What's silibrium?&quot; You know you're asking stupid questions at this point, but being hesitant and embarrassed is tiring. Slightly less surprised this time, Kota explains that silibrium is a fuel that's most abundant in Eba. Wonderlanders use it heavily but it's limited. The most obvious place to mine for it would be Eba if it weren't for the treaty with Wonderland. However, it looks like the Queen no longer cares. Wonderland has had the military power to crush Eba for quite a while so the treaty has been basically meaningless in recent times. And now that she has a reason to do so, the Queen could very well put an end to Eba. \n\n[[Make a rebellion]]</div><div tiddler="Do or Die" tags="" created="201306122253" modifier="twee" twine-position="314,4139">You and Anang are feeling a bit downtrodden as you walk through the village. You don't really want to retire home just yet because it feels as though you're accepting defeat so you guys decide to head to the amphitheater for what might be the last time. As you guys are walking you discuss what it would mean if the queen decided to destroy Eba to make it a silibrium plant. Where would the people of Eba go. Her people had always lived in Eba and many of them had never been outside of Eba. The Hautain and the Chiquay are people with a lot of pride who would had clung to their customs and lifestyles despite all the change around them. Anang knew that they would never go down without a fight. &quot;It would be bloody,&quot; she says. Especially since they don't know it's coming. She knew the queen was evil but the treaty... she guesses it was only a piece of paper to a queen. They have to stop her. By then they have reached the river and they run into Elai. He crossed the rock path. It's quite a surprise since he's never been to the Hautain side even though you guys have gone to the Chiquay side many many times. Elai is mumbling stuff to himself with different tones, like, casually, &quot;Oh! I'm just taking a walk, you?&quot; and, stone-faced, &quot;There's something I should've told you.&quot;\n\nYou ask Elai what he's doing over here and he notices you with a start. He says he's just... he takes a deep breath, and tells you that Kota's going back to the Capital to help with the rebellion. They're called the Royal Flush. They're kind of a mess, but the Royal Flush are the only people Kota knows who want to try to take down the Queen. Elai looks at you and waits for you to respond. You ask him, &quot;What about you?&quot; Elai says he doesn't know.

Life has become a lot more routine now and the fact that there even is a routine makes you realize you've made zero progress in your real goal of getting home. As you've finished serving breakfast, a cute red-headed guy is coming through the door &quot;Delivery for one beautiful Miss Allison,&quot; he sings. Considering you've talked to virtually no one since you've got here, this is perplexing. You take it, thank him, and sit down. The guy leaves, skipping, and you open the envelope. In it is a small piece of paper. It reads:\n\nWe're doing fine! Tell Sophie not to worry. - L&amp;C\n\nYou bolt upwards. Who is the guy who delivered this note, then? He must know where they are. You come out of the inn and look both ways, but he's already out of sight. \n\nSophie would love to hear this news, you think, so you run to tell her and she smiles, saying that of course they're doing fine. You're in a good mood all day as you work.\n\nThis good feeling wears off by the time you go to bed, however. You feel lonely once more. You read the message again and again in the light of the moon that streams from the window. You see through the paper finally and notice a print on the back. You turn on a lamp, turn it over, and look at the pattern. A bunny logo is on the back, very faintly. You know what you have to do with this. It has to be a clue to where they are, even just vaguely. So you're going to investigate it until they turn up.\n\nThe next day, you think about what to do. You look at the note again and again but you don't notice a single helpful thing about it. You've showed it to Sophie but she doesn't recognize the pattern.\n\nYou go around town on foot looking for signs or symbols that match the character on the note. But after wandering around for a few hours you come up short. You're right where you started. Feeling downtrodden you sit down on a street corner with your head in your hands. You're worried about Chess and Lonnie. They'd sent you the note but for some reason you were even more scared for them. Were they okay? Had they found somewhere safe? What was going on with the rebellion?\n\nSomeone places a small stuffed rabbit into your hands. You look up a little and see it's a little girl eating from a box of caramel popcorn. She says she likes to keep the toys that come with it but she already has this one so you can have it.

The loser owes everyone dinner. Sophie picks up the game the fastest, followed by Chess. Lonnie doesn't get it and keeps getting the rules confused with a similar game that he does know. He loses in last place and Chess wins. He's very upset about it but goes to prepare dinner. You play another game with Chess and Sophie and you win. You go into the kitchen and watch Lonnie, who has been preparing food. He's still upset and is stirring together a bunch of ingredients in a rush. You tell him that it's just a game and he cracks an egg into the bowl violently. You see a big piece of the eggshell fall into the mix. He lets out an angry sound and starts frying the mixture. You sit down. You note that he is avoiding your eyes. As he sets the fried food on paper towels on the table, you eat each one that is being put on the plate. You ask if you can have another and he gently pushes your mouth open with his finger and feeds you one. You blush and stand up. He's back to not meeting your eyes but he looks satisfied. He's starting to say, &quot;Do you like--&quot; when Chess comes in at just the right moment, declaring that Lonnie is taking too long, and tries the food. He spits it out immediately into the nearest garbage, complaining that it tasted like crab. Lonnie says it was crab. Chess says, well, he hopes Lonnie has money, because they're going to be eating out. Lonnie sinks into depression.\n\n[[Overhearing information]]</div><div tiddler="Go back to your room" tags="" created="201404190042" modifier="twee" twine-position="2099,140">You wonder why you had even decided to wander around anyway.

You trip over something on the ground. It seems to be a latch of some kind.  You lift it an inside there are trace amounts of a silvery liquid in there. You wonder what it is. You reach to touch it but March's voice interrupts you. He asks you what your doing in the dark. Madison says that the lights are out and the silibrium must have run out. He goes somewhere and comes back with a few gallons of a silver liquid and pours it in, before closing back the hatch. The light goes on. You ask what is that and he looks around confused. &quot;The silibrium?&quot; You nod. &quot;You don't use it at your house...?&quot; You shake your head and say no, what is it? March explains that it is a fuel that serves as Wonderland's primary energy source. Even other countries use it. He and Madison looks at you in a strange way.

You reach her house and go to bed. You lie in the bed and worry about if your parents are looking for you and whatever. You fall asleep after a while, noticing you still feel dizzy and light. The next day, when Anang is getting prepared for training, you come clean to her about being from NY and having no idea where you are, whatever.

Your feet don't touch the ground anymore.

He says stop wasting his time. You grit your teeth and make to leave. Anang starts to follow you but he calls out to Anang not to ruin herself in bad company.

March seems disappointed for a few seconds but gets over it and tells you to have fun with Madison.\n\nHowever, you don't actually work alongside Madison since you're the dishwasher. He didn't try to interact too much today (probably because you didn't break another dish) and you leave work earlier. Madison said he'd be home around 9, as the Queen requires dinner to be served at eight sharp. You wait for Madison to comes home at night, and it's dark when he does. You sat on the porch and raised a hand to say hi as he approached, but he coldly brushes past you in the middle of your greeting. You quickly follow him inside and ask him if he's okay. He doesn't respond, just keeps walking. You touch his shoulder gently and he whips around, and giving you a look so angry it scares you, says &quot;You just don't know when you're wanted, do you?!&quot;  or something. hallway with his bedroom in it. You dart around him and stand in front of his room door, spreading yourself out to block him off. He folds his arms, infinitely annoyed with you. It's not the most mature thing you could do, but... &quot;I just want to know what's wrong... Yeah, I don't know anything about this world or anything but... if you told me, maybe--&quot; &quot;The Queen was more demanding than usual today,&quot; he says simply. He smiles but it doesn't reach his eyes. He turns the doorknob and you're so surprised by the utter sadness of his smile that you just step out of the way as he enters the room. He sits down on the bed, facing the window with his back to you. You stand in the doorway and look at him. Then you leave for the kitchen. You make warm caramel chai tea, something you used to make at home, and crackers and cheese, and bring it to his room. He's still sitting the same way. You join him and pass him the drink and food. He looks a little surprised, but you just say &quot;You didn't eat, right?&quot; You say that when you were little, when you were sad, your mom used to tell you to make a list of all the things that make you happy. Madison says flatly that he thinks that's silly. You shrug and leave.\n\nThe next morning, on the kitchen table, hastily shoved under a placemat, are the first three items of a list written in pencil. Feeling embarrassed at having seen something you weren't meant to see, you push the list under the placemat to hide it completely.\n\nSince Madison doesn't bother to cook at home and March doesn't know how to cook, you start cooking for them. There are days when Madison comes home with cold eyes, but while he doesn't say anything to you, he no longer brushes past you. He nods with acknowledgment and lets you sit next to him in his room. You wish you knew what happened to him, but you figure that the progress you've made is enough for now.\n\n[[Cooking]]</div><div tiddler="Hide next to the plant" tags="" created="201601170047" modifier="twee" twine-position="1666,3111">You duck behind the plant and a minute later Madison exits the room. A cold sweat runs down your neck and you pray he won't spare a look down your end of the hallway. He doesn't and leaves. Eventually, you make it back to the kitchen.\n\nTheo gives you a look. &quot;Couldn't find him?&quot;\n\n&quot;Huh?&quot;\n\n&quot;You didn't give him the cupcake.&quot;\n\nYou totally forgot in the middle of all of that... Depressed, you just eat it yourself. Not bad, but a sad mood puts a damper on its flavor.\n\n[[Madison: Tax problems]]</div><div tiddler="Go with her" tags="" created="201212310226" modifier="twee" twine-position="351,60">You get to the village and everyone is staring at you because you're wearing sweatpants and a leotard. You observe your surroundings. It's pretty advanced looking, kinda like the treehouse in The Swiss Family Robinson, except for like a city. In the village, everyone has colorful hair except the old people who look like the elders of the village and some particulary intimidating, strong-looking people. (They turn out to be the warriors, young people who haven't ever seen a real conflict but are really amped about being warriors and are still muscular. Anang wants to join them, apparently.) But yeah, you can't observe that good because she's dragging you at high speeds to the elder (or the least uptight of them, anyway). \n\nElder Meekly is friendly and jovial but is dubious that she is actually from that faraway land. She happens to resemble a young woman he met from there one time. He asks if you are related to her. Lie or be honest?\n\n[[Lie to the elder]]\n[[Be honest to the elder]]</div><div tiddler="Try the middle" tags="" created="201212311552" modifier="twee" twine-position="270,751">You die.</div><div tiddler="It's a deal" tags="" created="201301072242" modifier="twee" twine-position="318,1869">You turn to Katori and grudgingly tell her it's a deal. Anang asks Elai if he knows that boy and Elai says he does. He is a decent person, Elai says, someone way too good for a spoiled brat like her.\n\nKatori is not offended but amused and says &quot;We shall see.&quot; She stands there for a while before frowning. &quot;So when can I expect results? I'm not getting any younger.&quot;\n\nElai's fists are tightly clenched and he has a look of extreme annoyance on his face. &quot;I'll talk to him and try to get something set up for this time tomorrow. When we meet up, try not to look like a total Hautain?&quot; He starts to approach the boy but you stop him. &quot;What about me?&quot; &quot;You try to look normal.&quot; He leaves.\n\nAs planned, you meet him and the boy at the same spot the next day. He introduces the boy to you all as Wes. Wes says he heard about how you all are from the city. All the females share a glance but say nothing. Elai says he told Wes that you guys are from a landlocked place so you want to see the water. Elai asked Wes to take you all out on his family's fishing boat and he kindly agreed. So Wes takes you all to the boat and everyone gets on it. On the boat, Katori annoys him with her dumb questions about how the boat moves without silibrium. Elai and Allison do their best to heavyhandedly push Katori and Wes together. It doesn't really work. Because Katori isn't doing anything to hide it, Wes eventually figures out that Katori isn't from the city but is just a Hautain. Then the boat hits a rough spot and bumps around a little. Katori falls on top of Wes and he gets a look down her shirt. They are in love and Operation Get Them Together is a success.\n\nOne day everyone's working on the amphitheater and then it gets dark and cold so Elai lights a fire... Something rustles in the bushes, Chardon screams, and Anang says it must be the Flying Dutchman and Wes is mildly surprised that Anang knows the story as well. And then Wes and Anang tell the story (though there are slight differences). Then Elai sees them off as they walk back across the tree bridge. You are about to go across too (you are the last one) but you stop and ask Elai if the story is true. Elai looks like he's about to reassure you that it isn't but then he says it is and laughs. He ruffles your hair and the two of you head to your respective homes.\n\n[[About Wonderland]]\n</div><div tiddler="We're here to see the jello lake." tags="" created="201306230305" modifier="twee" twine-position="853,1126">You loudly declare that you're here to see the jello lake.

Lonnie corrects himself. You state that you're gonna need another way to get into the castle. Lonnie mentions that he happens to have heard somewhere there they may be an underground network of tunnels. Everyone is ecstatic, but Theo questions why he didn't mention this before. Lonnie says that he thought the plan before would work, and anyway he's not totally sure. He will have to check with that aquaintance to find out where the entrance is.\n\nYou offer to go with him and he very vehemently refuses, saying he needs to protect that contact's identity no matter what.

Lonnie is starting to say that this is just too weird when a total stranger comes strolling into the warehouse. Everyone stiffens. Chess starts to say who the hell are you but you cut him off and say &quot;...March?&quot; March is surprised you recognized him. Chess asks where the heck he was  and why is he dressed like that. March shrugs and says he was getting some fresh air, and then sits down and asks what the order of business is for the day. Chess glares but then he says that they need to find Kota and get him with the rest of the group. March says he's already two steps ahead of him and to not worry about that anymore. He has a feeling Kota will be arriving soon. Chess is glaring again and complains about having to trust him on it but Lonnie gives him a sharp look because they've just talked about that the night before, so Chess shuts up.\n\nLonnie's route:\n\n[[Some time with Lonnie]]</div><div tiddler="In the Warehouse (Lonnie)" tags="" created="201308241919" modifier="twee" twine-position="895,2982">You look up and see Lonnie, who's looking at you in wordless, somewhat happy surprise. Chess behind him is in a stiff, offensive stance but his face is starting to take on a look of disbelief. A little further away is the guy who delivered the message, wearing a benign confused expression. Next to him is another guy a little shorter than Chess, whom you've never seen before (looking shocked, annoyed, and a little guilty all at once). You get the immediate impression that, despite his flamboyant taste in fashion, he is an adult, though he can't be much older than the others. It doesn't take long for them to figure out you're not a threat, so their eyes slowly turn to Chess who is looking more annoyed by the second. You turn your attention back to Lonnie. Your mind is flashing back to when he hugged you last time you saw him and it's sticking there. It feels like you haven't seen him in forever and he looks tired. You didn't do him any favors by suddenly showing up either, you realize.\n\n&quot;The note, right?&quot; Lonnie says with a wink. He wanted you to find them. The wink doesn't get past Chess.\n\n&quot;I knew sending the message was dangerous but I let you do it. Then you leave her a clue?&quot; Chess is steaming mad. &quot;What is going through your mind, Lonnie? You do realize it's our lives that are at stake with your little games, don't you?&quot; He has gripped Lonnie's shoulders tightly and forced him to face him. &quot;Anyone could have intercepted that note and tracked us down.&quot;\n\nLightheartedly, Lonnie jokes, &quot;No one in the Queen's army was smart enough to figure it out.&quot;\n\nYou think to yourself that it wasn't a matter of smarts but luck. &quot;You guys left tracks,&quot; you mumble. &quot;Outside the door, there were footprints. I don't know if it matters much, but I could easily narrow down which warehouse was occupied.&quot; Everyone's looking at you.\n\nChess roughly pushes Lonnie away. &quot;Right.

In a hard voice, you say you'll be extra careful then.\n\n &quot;Then do as you wish.&quot;\n\nYou put on your shoes and leave the warehouse. You start walking around its proximity but you're unsure of where March might be. All these warehouses look the same, so you're starting to get confused about where you are. The one you were in had a number on it, didn't it? You probably should've memorized it.\n\nYou sit down on the ground to think. Better to do that than to walk around and get even more lost.

He starts walking, complaining about how you're pulling him away from gathering firewood, which he needs to gather so his dad can cook. You ask why he doesn't just use silibrium and fiddle with it in your pocket to show him. He snatches out of your hand, suddenly very upset. Using silibrium is stupid, he says. It ruins the earth Mother Gaia blessed them with. There are better ways to get energy and better ways to do things. &quot;Like starting a fire? What about the smoke?&quot; He can't really answer, so he huffs and looks away. While he sulks, you point out a tree bridge that's in disrepair but still usable. You begin to scale the tree when your stomach growls loudly. You suddenly stop. He sighs a bigger sigh than ever before. &quot;I guess you're going to ask for food now, too?&quot; You weren't but whatever, if he's willing.\n\nHe takes you to the town square and gets you food from a kind middle-aged lady, who greeted him with &quot;Oh, Elai! Back from a long day of hunting?&quot; You pick up on this quickly and pointedly start calling him Elai. He tells you he didn't introduce himself for a reason. You introduce yourself as Allison anyway. After he gets you food, he begs you to please, please, please not come back because he has repaid your debt. You go back to Anang's side via the tree bridge and on the way to Anang's house you encounter a crazy old man, saying something that sounds meaningful. Then as he begins to say stuff that definitely doesn't make sense and just sounds like philosophical nosense, Anang finds you and tells the old guy to go away. Anang was looking for you. You ask who that was. Anang said it's just an old seer.\n\nA few days later, Anang has told you to get a certain herb for medicinal purposes and tells you it's near the river by the big trees before quickly going to her own task. When you arrive there, you realize it is indeed by the big trees... on the other side of the tree bridge. &lt;&lt;if $bridgefail&gt;&gt;You try to cross the tree bridge but just as you're almost across, the whole thing tears suddenly, you scream, and you're left dangling a few feet above the ground. Someone comes running. It's Elai. &quot;What the heck are you doing here and why can't you do anything without breaking something?!&quot; &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You cross the tree bridge and start, quietly, subtly picking the herb when Elai comes by. &quot;Why the heck are you here again? And stealing our food, too!&quot; You say it's not like he owns it. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;He says he told you not to come over here again. You say, well, you didn't expect to see him this soon. Just another one of the weird things have been happening lately (he complains about you changing the subject): you somehow land on a beach, you discovered there's another tribe, you met a crazy seer person... he cuts you off. A seer, he asks? You nod and say you don't really get it. He explains that the seer probably used to work for the Queen. &quot;The Queen?&quot; &quot;Of Wonderland.&quot; Wonderland...? You ask how he knows this. He tells you his brother is a diplomat for the Chiquay people who often spends time in the Queen's court in Terovius. You pull out your map and he shows you Terovius on it, as well as Eba. He says to himself, &quot;I guess you really aren't from around here...&quot; Duh. &quot;How did you get here?&quot; You tell him you're not sure... no, you fell down a sewer and woke up on a beach.

He asks for at least what continent it's on. You don't remember that either. He points to the map and says &quot;Surely one of these must look familiar.&quot; You shake your head and say &quot;It's definitely not any of those.&quot; Elai decides he will help you remember because he is curious about your world.\n\n[[On and on]]</div><div tiddler="Stay on the beach" tags="" created="201212310210" modifier="twee" twine-position="174,93">You stayed on the beach, waiting for someone to come find you. You fall asleep. When you open your eyes, a hostile jungle girl with brown skin and white hair is standing over you with a staff. You screamed.\n\nNext thing you know, you're tied up and the jungle girl, formerly confident, is now apparently confused about what to do with you. She starts poking around at you like you're weird. She debates with herself where you might be from, what you are, if she can sell you as a slave, if this will impress her brother, or what. The more she talks to herself like a weirdo, the less afraid you are. So you think, maybe I can talk my way out of this. &quot;Maybe you can untie my legs; I don't have to be carried, we can just walk together, right?&quot; She looks at you dubiously but sees your point and unties your feet, leaving your hands bound. As you walk, you begin to get on her side by starting a discussion about the more personal things she ranted about, like her brother. The further you get, the less bound your hands are. \n\nBy the time you're almost at her village, your arm is on her shoulder like your buddies. You take the opportunity to snatch the staff from her and do a fancy baton twirl, ending in a pose you saw in a Jackie Chan movie. She, not skilled with the staff, is scared and impressed by your skills and begs you to spare her life and make her your apprentice. She hurriedly introduces herself as Anang. You coolly agree to it, and also say your name, and start to get a little full of yourself. You claim to be from a land faraway and she starts assuming all sorts of things: &quot;Oh, you're from the land of legend?! I've heard so much about your people! Is it true that...&quot; Bewildered and a little out of sorts, you just agree to what she says. Excited, she drags you to her village even faster. &quot;Come meet Elder Meekly!

However they know off-hand that not only was it very costly and a huge waste of taxpayer money, but that it killed the fishing industry in the area.

Your mind goes to how you're going to get home. You think about your family and friends at school and notice that you are unable to recall some simple details about them. As you become distracted with your thoughts, Madison and March point out that dinner is burning. You quickly turn off the stove and they look at you expectantly, waiting for you to tell them what's wrong. You explain that you're worried about getting back home... and also that you're starting to forget what home is like. March is surprised. &quot;So fast?! Maybe it's just early onset Alzheimers?&quot; &quot;Very funny,&quot; you say flatly. You explain your idea that maybe you're here to do something? After all, you say thoughtfully, in books, whenever the protagonist gets transported to another world... she discovers that she has cool magical abilities and saves the world. Halfway through your explanation, March and Madison's faces go from seriously attentive to &quot;oh, tell me more&quot; sarcastic. March says that he wouldn't count on it and Madison says why don't you focus some of that magical energy of yours on not burning dinner next time. You slump.\n\nYou serve a charred dinner and March and Madison eat it slowly and reluctantly.\n\nMarch's path:\nWhen they finish, March stays behind to pat you on the head. &quot;I don't know about magical powers but maybe there might be something to that other thing you said. Maybe you are here to do something.&quot; He leaves.\n\nMadison's path:\nWhen they finish, March leaves but Madison lingers in the room for a while and watches you start to wash the dishes. Then he walks over and gently pushes you aside as he takes over. &quot;You've washed enough dishes for the day at work. Go get some rest.&quot; You look at him. After a while, he adds &quot;And quit worrying. You'll ruin your face&quot; and flicks some soap water at you. You soften. &quot;Thanks,&quot; you say.

Then you stumble on a long, loose floorboard that goes from under your foot to under the house of cards and the cards spring out of formation as your foot sinks down lower than it should. You regain your footing but it's too late. The cards are everywhere. You apologize profusely and March tries to hide the pain in his voice as he says it's totally cool and stands up. &quot;So what did you want to talk about?&quot; he asks. It feels hideous that you actually didn't have anything in mind to talk about at all, but you can't tell him that now so you come up with something quick. &quot;What's with all the Lapis stuff?&quot; you ask. Not bad.\n\nHe explains that Madison's father owns Lapis and that he gets all this stuff free. &quot;You didn't know?&quot; he asks.\n\nYou shake your head no. He raises an eyebrow and smiles before saying that it's weird how you don't seem the least bit surprised or impressed. You say, well, he hasn't done anything yet so why would you be impressed? He blinks, the smile disappearing from his face.

After work March brings her a snack from the company. There is a prize at the bottom. She says something profound (quoting Harry Potter) and he is impressed. \n\nCamille comes by the store and gets jealous. March obviously knows her and seems even to be amused by her. He says she comes to the food store everyday to buy that same snack. Camille says she really loves it. But you have the sneaking suspicion that while the snack is in fact delicious thats not all she comes there for. Camille buys 12 boxes of the snack when she sees March giving you attention but declines March's offer to carry them. March tells you to pack up the advertisement stuff and put it away. He then leaves saying he'll see you at home.\n\nWhen he leaves you see Camille struggling and you offer to help her carry the stuff. Camille is surprised and starts asking you a million questions about how you know March and what does he mean by see you at home. You say that you're staying at his house. She asks if youre his girl friend but she doesnt wait for you to reply quickly dismissing the idea. She doesnt give her reason but you're still mildly offended. She introduces herself as Camille. You notice that her way of speaking is a little more rough sounding now that March is gone.  You offer one last time to help her and she looks like she briefly considers it but says no thanks and hurries away.  You notice that she's forgotten a few boxes. You take it upon yourself to help yourself.

You are amazed by it as he puts it to work and he is confused by your awe. He realizes that you really havent seen it. He asks you how things are powered where you're from and you tell him oil.

At any cost. So Elai had better tell her where Kota is because she's going to follow him.\n\nSilence. Then Elai says she's right and that he at least has to try to help however he can. Then he turns to you and tells you that he'll try to come home as often as he can and tell you whatever he finds out, but you smoothly cut him off. You don't live here, you remind him, and as far as you can tell, the way home isn't in Eba. So you might as well move on, and the rebellion looks as good a place as any.

You're starting to get the feeling that you're much, much farther from home than you thought. It's dumb but... you get the sinking feeling you are in another world. Anang tells you that if you're going to be staying with them, you should make yourself useful. Every day, Anang gathers wood, leaves, berries, and other useful materials. She suggests that you help by doing the same. You promise you will. But for now, you will get some sleep.\n\nFor the next two weeks, you gather berries and plants with Anang and the other gatherers. One day, you and Anang are supposed to gather a certain type of berry far from the settlement but Anang's help is requested by Elder Meekly so you'll be going alone. Anang gives you a flashcard with a picture of the berry on it. The flashcards are for trainees, she explains. She tells you where you can find the berry. Anyway, with this, you nervously embark on your trip.\n\nNear a rushing river and a bridge, you finally find the berries. You start to put them in your basket when you see something in the corner of your eye across the river. It's a boy, looking around in a hurry. Then he's running off after some animal. He looks different from all of the people of Anang's tribe, you note. You're about to follow him but then you notice that the bridge is very broken down and looks unsafe. You put the idea of your mind and go back to picking the berries. Putting the berries in your basket, you return to the settlement.\n\nThe next couple of times you go back near the bridge, you are with the other gatherers. You consider asking Anang about who the boy from before could've been, but you get the feeling it's a bad idea.\n\nAfter that, when you go back again, just you and Anang this time, you see the boy across the bridge. You are about to go closer but Anang, who was a little further away, concentrating on getting some plant, calls to you. You run back over to Anang but when you look back across the bridge, the boy is gone.\n\nThen one time, once more, you are at the bridge by yourself. You see the boy again. He is trying to catch some kind of animal next to the bridge, on the rocky slope down into the water. He is about to step on a rock that isn't as stable as he thinks it is. You call out to him to watch out. He steps back and sees that the step was indeed about to crumble beneath him. He looks up at you with a look of recognition on his face. After a while of blatant staring at each other, he looks away and says thank you. He looks like he's gonna leave but you shout out for him to wait because you're intrigued by him. You can try to cross the bridge on its left side, its right side, or in the middle.\n\n[[Try the left side]]\n[[Try the middle]]\n[[Try the right side]]\n\n</div><div tiddler="BAR BAR BAR" tags="" created="201501040010" modifier="twee" twine-position="2086,2822">One day, March invites you to a bar. You tell Camille that March is inviting you to a bar, and what the bar is called. Later, when you arrive at the bar with March, Camille is there. March looks slightly annoyed for some reason and asks why Camille is there. You say you don't know, you just mentioned to her you were coming here. Madison is there too. March wants to have fun with you, so he shows you how to play pool. Physically. Camille is extremely jealous. Then a blonde guy with a hat and a very tall black haired guy enter and they call to March and Madison. March's expression shifts to a serious one before apologizng and going to him, and Madison goes to them as well. They sit down at a table elsewhere and talk in hushed tones. You're confused by what made March get so serious, but  decide to amuse yourself for the next hour by talking to Camille [You learn her backstory here]. March and Madison get up to leave and tell you simply to come. It was a good night at the beginning but it didn't end as well as it started.\n\nThe next day, you work on the script some more after you come home from work. Madison arrives a little late with groceries. He looks tired, so you pack all of them out for him. March remarks with surprise that you've learned where everything goes. Madison says flatly that it means you're getting rather comfortable here and asks if you've given going home any thought recently. Then you realize that it's been days since you've thought about home, but you're embarrassed to say that, so you say that of course you have. You say that you gotta go now, and dash away to your room, but not before Madison calls out &quot;go where exactly.&quot; In your room, you look at the riddle again. Liar rabbit? Could that have something to do with Lapis? Or maybe there's an actual rabbit?

He gets a little defensive. He says that's official business between elders and tells you not to worry about it. He asks why you're here and you thank him for letting you stay there. He says it's not a problem. He asks you how you're adjusting to life in Eba. You flinch and say you're adjusting too well for someone who should be trying to get home. He gives you a wise smile and says he wishes he could help you more and that he can tell you're a good person. He says he is sure you're here for a reason and that already a lot of things have changed since you've been here. Anang, who used to be an idiot, has found her place in society and you have been really helpful. You thank him even though you feel his words are far too kind. You have to get home since you promised Anangs mom you'd help with dinner.\n\nThe next day, Anang's mother tells you that there will be a special guest at dinnertime today and Anang grumbles about how it's the crazy old seer and how most people bring the food to him instead of inviting him into their homes. Anang's mom asks you to gather some fruit. By now, you know the better fruits of that species grow on the Chiquay side, so you go there. You ask Elai to accompany you, figuring he might know where the very best trees are. You climb the tree to pick the fruit but eventually after picking a few, you misjudge how strong a branch is that you've rested your weight on and come crashing down. Onto Elai. It isn't cute or graceful--you've hit him in the face. &quot;Ow ow ow ow ow...&quot; You apologize profusely. While trying to sit up, you're about to accidentally hit him again and he rolls on top of you and restrains your hands before you can. &quot;... sorry! Sorry! Reflex! It's just a reflex! A reflex...&quot; After a while, his apologies start to die down and you're left just staring at one another, not moving...\n\nAnd then Anang falls from the tree on top of you guys. Your head bangs into Elai's. She starts interrogating you about why Elai is on top of you, why you came to the Chiquay side to get something that's on the Hautain side, why you needed Elai's help to do that, etc. You try to explain it away as something innocent and she nods and says &quot;uh-huh, sure, I believe you&quot; but obviously isn't buying it. Then she reveals that she has already gathered a full pack of the fruits that you were sent to get, on her own and tells you it's time to go home.\n\nYou are eating dinner with Anang's family. Her brother is going on about some new warrior exercise regimen with Anang and you could hardly care less. The seer is quiet for most of the meal but then again the only one who is even trying to exchange words with him is Anang's mom. But she's just trying to be a good host. You haven't said a word all night. You look at the seer closely and see that he's mostly just gazing into space until suddenly he's staring at you very strangely, like he knows you. It makes you uncomfortable because other than that one awkward encounter in the village you have never talked to him before. But the way he's looking at you is like he's looking at an old friend. One that he's angry with. He tells you that you're late. You're confused. Late for what? Finally he tells you that you have your mother's eyes. How would he know what your mother looked like? He then says some other weird stuff and you remember that the man was nuts. Sensing your distress Anang's mom announces that it's time for dessert and you politely decline and head off to bed to get away from the weirdness. But you wonder if maybe the seer could be useful in getting home.\n\n[[At the amphitheater]]</div><div tiddler="The flammable silibrium (March)" tags="" created="201401200219" modifier="twee" twine-position="1280,6307">&quot;The flammable silibrium,&quot; you say definitively. &quot;According to the plan, it was supposed to be non-flammable so it wouldn't combust when they tried to use it, right?&quot;\n\nMarch stops you. &quot;Okay, so I screwed up. Does it matter? Yeah, the fake silibrium caught fire. So what? It wouldn't work as a fuel either way because it's not actual silibrium. Can you power a car by pouring matches into its fuel tank?

Katori sees you two leaving in a suspicious way and stops you, saying that she and Chardon also want to come.\n\nWhen you get there, Wes is helping Elai dig holes in the amphitheater. Wes's face brightens upon seeing Katori and Katori's chest. Katori runs into Wes's arms and they gaze into each other's eyes before engaging in an intense makeout session, much to the dismay of you, Anang, and Elai. &quot;Haven't they just met each other?&quot; grumbles Elai. He is averting his eyes, blushing. But he's also stealing glances at you. Wes talks about wanting to take care of Katori and marriage, and Katori eats it up. Elai cuts in coldly and says that that never will happen because Wes is Chiquay and Katori is Hautain. They look at him in disbelief and then Wes says &quot;Why does that matter?&quot;\n\nElai opens his mouth to give the obvious answer but of course there isn't one. You have been wondering about this very topic a lot since you came to Eba. The Chiquay and the Hautains hate each other quite fiercely but when it comes to the root of the matter no one really knows why. You ask everyone there but no one really knows. Elai says that the Hautains are thieves, but the way he says it is robotic, as though he's repeating something he'd heard many times. You ask him how many Hautains that he knows. The only ones he knows are Katori, Chardon, and Anang, and they've never stolen anything. Well, except for the fruit on the Chiquay side, he jokes and everyone laughs. Then Katori brings up something that she heard her father say, that the Chiqauy are backwards people who are jealous of the Hautain. You ask her why. She says it's because they have Silibrium. Elai says that Silibrium is dangerous and that the Hautain are reckless with its use. Anang defends her people and says that silibrium is safe and that it helps the lives of so many. Elai says that's why they fought, it was over the silibrium, in the end they couldn't agree and to avoid the bloodshed they separated and for the past 70 years have had little to no contact with each other. You bring up a point of how silly it is that two groups of people who could help each other have spent so long hating each other. Katori concedes that her people are in fact a little too dependent on the silibrium and that they could learn a thing or two from the Chiquay. This is revolutionary coming from the chief's daughter. Everyone is surprised but can all agree that the fighting is dumb. They as a people have missed out on a lot of good times and agree that maybe it's time that they as they did something to change it. But how? Everyone is silent as they think hard. After a while, you say that they probably aren't going to come up with a grand solution after thinking about it for just one day. \n\nElai looks at you sharply as if realizing something. None of this is your problem, he reminds you. You should be focusing on getting home. Wherever that is. This reminds you of what you were thinking about after dinner yesterday and you ask Elai what he knows about seers because you think it might be a lead on getting home. &quot;Well...&quot; You ask him if they work for the Queen, right? He nods. You ask him if they can see more than just the future but maybe into other worlds. He gets a little uncomfortable and says he doesn't know that much about them. He then tells you that he knows his brother will be in town the day after tomorrow and he will be able to answer your questions. You look a little disappointed but Elai pats you on the back and invites you to get to work on the amphitheater.\n\n[[Katori's plan]]</div><div tiddler="Eavesdrop" tags="" created="201301110152" modifier="twee" twine-position="451,2636"> He's having a hushed conversation with another elder but you can only hear the end of it.

Elai says, not smugly, that he thought so. \n\n Anang says she'll try to be less conspicuous next time but Elai says there might not be a next time. He says remember how Kota is a diplomat for the Chiquay people? Kota has heard from other diplomats who he is friends with that the Queen is planning to take Eba by force for its silibrium. &quot;What?!&quot; exclaims Anang. You say that's terrible. Elai agrees. He says that there is a rebellion, though. Anang insists that she has to inform the Chief, then. You are openly dubious that the Chief will listen, but Anang says she has to. You tell Elai you have to go and he says no, he'll help you cross the river to get back. So Anang gives Elai one side of the rope, runs across the stones, and ties it to a tree on the other side. Elai ties it to a tree on this side and tells you to hold the rope when crossing. You cross nervously but safely and go to see the Chief when you realize you have a poor relationship with him and this may not have been the best of ideas. You let Anang walk ahead of you but you're spotted immediately.\n\n&quot;You,&quot; the Chief says with instant contempt.

You find Madison who introduces himself and explains that March found you out in the middle of nowhere. Madison asks what happens but you're still too weak to say much so Madison says he will let you stay little longer. You pass out again. The next day March has brought you a change of clothes because you can't keep wearing the same clothes indefinitely.\n\nYou try to use his phone to call home but don't even know how to work rotary phones. He calls for you but the number doesn't exist.\n\nYou realize that you aren't anywhere close to home. Judging by the architecture you have seen out your window, you are probably in Denmark. The question is how did you get to Denmark? Her parents were probably worried sick. Madison is trying to be hospitable since he can tell that you're a long way from home and broke. He asks you the basic questions of where you're from and what your business is in the country but your answers are unsatisfactory to him and he quickly grows frustrated. You soon realize that this place can't possibly be Denmark. After all, don't they speak Danish in Denmark? You ask Madison where you guys are and he tells you you're in Wonderland. He leaves and goes to work. That same evening March comes home. He looks completely different from to how he looked the last time you saw him. He's a very friendly guy and puts you at ease. You apologize for not knowing the answers to the questions. He brushes it off and instead asks you questions that you would know the answers to. Like your name and age and weight. You choose to not disclose all this information.\n\nYou've been at this house for a few days and you haven't ventured out further than the room youve been staying in. March informs you that youre not a prisoner so you need to stop acting like one. So you choose to listen to his words and explore the house a little bit. From what you've collected it's shared by Madison and March who you assume are brothers though they share no resemblance. But maybe youre jumping to too many conclusions. They could be lovers. You find yourself to be in what looks like a kitchen. You were a bit on the hungry side. You try to flick on the lights but it seems like the light bulb is blown. You look around the cabinets for a spare but find none. You consider looking for March or Madison to inform them about the light. Madison said he was going to be doing some work he'd taken home from his job and March said he was going to take a nap. Or maybe you should leave them both alone and just go back to your room.\n\n[[Go to Madison]]\n[[Go to March]]\n[[Go back to your room]]</div><div tiddler="Another work day" tags="" created="201601162320" modifier="twee" twine-position="1776,2959">You're back at work and taking your usual break from dishes in between the dishes for breakfast or lunch. This means organizing and doing inventory. You saw there was a bit of leftover ingredients so you decided to make a cupcake for Madison as a thank you for the day before. That was twenty minutes ago and now you're done with inventory and the cupcake is done and cooling. \n\nTheo pops by. &quot;One cupcake?&quot;\n\nYou nod and explain it's for Madison. His eyes widen and he says &quot;Oh? Well, isn't /he/ special then?&quot; with a grin.\n\n&quot;It's not like that. He gave me some medicine stuff yesterday and I just wanted to thank him.&quot; Theo stares at you blankly. &quot;And maybe he's a teeny bit special.&quot; He breaks into a wide grin again, and you immediately focus your attention on icing the cupcake. You draw a golden star with little rays of light coming off of it.\n\n&quot;I knew it! If you wanna give that to him, he's in the ballroom overlooking the setup of the tables. I'll have to head over there in a minute myself, since I'm a guest. But you can go on ahead for now.&quot; He looks busy with some hors d'oeuvres, so you go on ahead. As you walk to the ballroom, you notice the halls become more and more busy. \n\nYou enter the ballroom and see staff running around hectically setting up tables and flowers and other decorations. And far across all of this disorder is Madison, leaving through another door. You yell to him and he doesn't hear. You scurry across the room, accidentally bumping into a few people carrying fancy glass flower vases but thankfully no one drops anything because of you.\n\nThe hallway you enter following Madison is just as busy. You call his name a few more times but he doesn't hear you and is so far ahead. You start outright running because he's about to turn down a hallway, but you're not fast enough to catch him before the turn. Where is he going anyway? You get the crazy idea to maybe /not/ call after him. Maybe you should follow him covertly. You reach the corner he turned around fast enough to see him enter a room far down the hall.\n\nQuietly you tiptoe to the door and read the sign on it. &quot;ONLY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL PERMITTED.&quot; What business does he have in there? There's no window.\n\nYou stand there and ponder until you hear activity in the room. Your heart fills with panic and you freeze in place until you start to hear footsteps, almost impossible to hear it but growing in volume. You need to get out of there right now but how? There's a tall, large, densely leaved potted plant a short dash from here, in a corner. You could take a chance and duck down behind it, but it may not provide the best cover. Or you could try to hightail it out of the hallway altogether, but the exit is a bit far. Would you make it?\n\n[[Hide next to the plant]]\n[[Get out of the hallway altogether]]</div><div tiddler="Meeting Kota" tags="" created="201306250359" modifier="twee" twine-position="1057,1423">A flower vase lies on the ground shattered. A mom is making her child apologize to you about it, so you say it's okay and pick up the pieces. Then you tell Sophie you're going out to replace it. \n\nOn the way to the store, an native American looking guy who looks about 30 asks you for directions to the inn. Luckily, you haven't gotten far from it, so you can just tell him he needs to make a right. You continue to the store, buy the vase, and come back. When you're back at the inn, you see the guy from earlier sitting at a table in the back, discussing something that looks serious with Chess and Lonnie, who are exchanging tense glances. You fill some glasses with water in the kitchen, put them on a tray, and come by and ask if they would like a glass. You're really just trying to eavesdrop. They say no thanks to the water, but you loiter in the area giving water to other people anyway. \n\nThe guy is saying to them that he wants to help with the rebellion. Something very important to him is at stake now and he can't afford to sit back anymore. The Queen is planning to take Eba for its silibrium, he tells them. You don't know what he's saying but Chess and Lonnie look surprised. Lonnie repeats &quot;take?&quot; and the guy says &quot;Yes. By force, if necessary. And, as you've probably guessed, that's where my family lives. So I can't exactly allow her to do with Eba as she pleases.&quot; Chess stands up and says in a flat voice, &quot;Well, sorry to disappoint you but there is no rebellion,&quot; before starting to walk away but the guy just gets up, too. Pleading, he says that's not possible, he's spent the past month trying to track them down, he's heard of the rebellion and he knows it's real. Chess says they failed to organize it well and it never got off the ground. The man insists that it can't end like this and that they have to fight. Chess gives him a hard look and says that he's just going to have to fight on his own, before leaving. Lonnie apologizes to the guy and says he'll talk to Chess. The guy is appreciative. \n\nTo your surprise, he gestures for you to come over. He says he knows you've been paying attention to the whole conversation but that's fine. He introduces himself as Kota and you introduce yourself, too. You say, &quot;There's a rebellion?&quot; Kota smiles and says you can't go spread that around.

You try not to look like you're eavesdropping, but... well, you're eavesdropping. The two middle aged men are talking about how tired they are of her antics. One complains about her recent increased taxes on various white objects, just because she hates the color so much. The other mentions that they still can't get over the fact that she had a jello lake made.

Her logic is that if she brings over Chiquay technology to the Hautain side, the Hautains will be in awe at the alternative to silibrium and the elders and chief will be inspired to work together with brilliant inventors like the Chiquay. Chardon thinks Katori's idea is great, and Wes agrees, primarily because it's Katori. You're kind of in shock that anyone could think of something so dumb and Elai is flabbergasted and immediately against the idea. Anang is unsure but Katori offers her a persuasive argument: Anang will be seen as the bravest warrior for crossing over to the Chiquay side. Anang looks more torn than ever but Elai loudly repeats his disapproval of the whole idea and you nod along. Katori is silent for a second before saying that Elai is probably right. She invites him to share his own ideas. Elai stutters before admitting that he has none but then says that it's better for everyone to  take some more time to brainstorm than to rush into something ill-conceived. Katori looks defeated but nods. Chardon says that, yeah, they should probably think over it some more, and Wes also agrees after being nudged by Chardon. Anang doesn't say anything. \n\nAfter you're all done working on the amphitheater for the day, you ask Elai if he can take you to get more of those tasty pastries he gave you from before. So as you're walking to the market, you sigh in relief that that went well and Elai stiffens at the words. &quot;What?&quot; you demand. He says that your saying that has suddenly brought to his attention how suspicious it was. &quot;You don't really think they're still thinking about it, do you?&quot; He says of course they are. Even if they are, you argue, they should still be given the benefit of the doubt. They'll make the right choice in the end. You spot the pastry you came for and point it out in glee. Elai looks reluctant but goes along with your forceful dropping of the topic and goes to buy the pastry for you. When you thank him, he looks happy, if a little awkward. He mentions that his brother will be here the day after tomorrow and your questions can be answered soon. As he says that, he squeezes your hand and you can tell he's nervous but you don't say anything. As you are on your way out of the marketplace, you pass a middle-aged lady who you recognize. You wave to her excitedly, recognizing her as the person who Elai got food from before (in &quot;Broken Bridge Dilemma&quot;) and Elai's starting to yank you away by the hand when he realizes it's too late and the lady's already seen you and is greeting you. She asks Elai to introduce you two and Elai introduces you as his friend from outside of Eba. The lady says she can tell. Elai introduces her as Evea, who is his guardian. INSERT BACKSTORY.

He tells you what he knows from his brother. There is a Queen and also a less infamous King. The Queen is crazy but not really a problem for them as she generally leaves the people of Eba alone. &quot;Crazy?&quot; you ask. Elai says he heard that she drained a lake near the capital and refilled it with jello. You are suitably skeptical. You ask what the country is like. He says it's mostly farmland with only three towns. Then, a little depressed, Elai says his brother used to come home more often but it looks like now he's got some sort of project and he can't find the time. Suddenly, as you are talking to Elai, Anang bursts out of nowhere. She tells you she's been looking for you. The chief would like to speak to you. You wonder what the chief could possibly have to say to you.

One of the guys quickly agrees asking you what's there to like? The queen is crazy and unpredictable. From what you gather the queen isn't the most popular person in town.

But you nag him a bit so he promotes a random fruit drink from the refrigerator and it sells out. You are flabbergasted that he works here every day but doesn't use any sort of sales tactics. Does he not want to move up? Camille remarks that as the heir to Lapis, March does not have any moving up to do. You look at March to confirm whether it's true and he just shrugs.

This is the first I've seen it.&quot; You both stare at it together and eventually Madison sees you two standing and struggling to both look at a tiny scrap of paper and he comes over. &quot;What is this?&quot; he asks. &quot;Some type of riddle, I think.&quot; March answers. Madison reads aloud, &quot;'Go back the way she came...' Hm.&quot; He pauses. &quot;If I may propose something that may seem a little... farfetched... regardless of where it came from, could this be a way for you to get home, Alice?&quot;\n\nYou correct him on your name and he apologizes. &quot;That could be it,&quot; you respond thoughtfully. &quot;But we still don't know what it means. Who is 'she'? What the heck is a liar rabbit...?&quot;\n\nMadison closes your hand around the riddle. &quot;There's plenty of time to think it over. I'm sure we'll have a grand epiphany soon enough, so you needn't worry about it. It'll all come to us eventually,&quot; he says reassuringly before leaving.\n\nYou sigh and sit down with resignation. March sits down next to you. You complain that you don't have time. You can't wait around here forever--now that you're rested, you need to get home. Your parents must be extremely worried about you. After all, you've disappeared for days without a trace.\n\nMarch says don't worry about what Madison said. Madison's way of dealing with things, he explains, is to put them off or ignore them. &quot;Hey, that's not a nice thing to say about your friend!&quot; you say.

Just stand still.\n\nKota walks in and everyone looks incredulously from him to March. Kota tells March that he got his message and March says duh. Realization dawns and Chess says that March contacted Kota and Kota says yeah, he left a message in his house. You're looking around absently and notice someone peeking through the window briefly and get scared all over again. &quot;Uh, guys, I think we're being watched.&quot;\n\nMarch nods. &quot;Yeah, I'm getting to that.&quot;\n\n&quot;No... I think we're being watched, like, right now...&quot; You glance back at the window and see no one there--\n\nThe warehouse door slams open and two kids your age who appear to be confident except for their shaking legs step in.\n\n&quot;I am Elai of the Tribe of Chiquay...&quot;\n\n&quot;and I am Warrior Anang of the proud Hautain people of Eba...&quot; Elai shoots her a quick distressed look but the look is quickly gone.\n\n&quot;And we are here to join the rebellion!&quot; They say together finally.\n\nYou look at them skeptically. &quot;...what?&quot;\n\nMadison asks for an explanation and Kota says with frustration that it's his little brother and a girl from the neighboring tribe and they stowed away in his car. Again. Kota says he has no idea why they keep doing it and they say they said they want to join the rebellion. Kota says the rebellion's not a place for kids and Elai says &quot;Then why's she here?&quot;, gesturing towards you. You bristle. Chess looks at him accusingly and Kota responds not to worry, they're going back home right now. March says that's the thing. They can't. You see, when March went to Kota's house, he just wanted to talk to him but he noticed that Kota's house was under surveillance. So he can't send Elai and Anang back there, because they could be in danger. Madison nods to that and Chess grunts. Now what's weird, March says, is that they didn't keep watching him once he left the house. He thinks there may be a traitor among them. Chess says that it's possible that it's just some sort of trap and that that's a lot to assume. Lonnie agrees and Madison says nothing but folds his arms. Chess says that there's no point in deliberating about this if they're not even certain it's true.\nSo, for Kota, Chess repeats the plan. They are going to replace the silibrium supply of the Queen's area of the castle with fake silibrium. This will leave the area without power, allowing them to get close to the Queen. Kota asks how they're going to make fake silibrium but Chess says it's already been done. It's located in another warehouse. March grins sheepishly and apologizes to everyone for not mentioning it. Elai asks how they're going to get the silibrium inside the castle and everyone gives him a dubious and/or dirty look. Chess responds that the person who is delivering the fake silibrium to the castle is the person who used to deliver food to the inn. Anang asks how they're going to get them to use the fake silibrium instead of theirs. Chess says that the maintenance person at the castle doesn't like the Queen and Chess already convinced him to join their side. Any more questions? You shake your head. &quot;Then we should be good to go,&quot; he said finally. &quot;We need to meet with our contact in the castle tonight and make sure the plan's set in stone. So Lonnie and I should head off now.&quot;\n\n&quot;In the castle?&quot; you question. Lonnie shakes his head. &quot;We're not meeting the contact IN the castle.

You're about to get up and leave when Madison comes out of the door holding a notebook. You peek in briefly. All you can tell by glancing is that it's definitely not a bathroom. He closes the door back and asks why you're in his room, with irritation. You explain that the bulb in the kitchen is blown. He leaves with you to go find a replacement bulb. He changes the bulb but the light still doesn't work. He asks you if you'd checked the silibrium store. You are confused. He checks the store of silibrium--a little inconspicuous hatch on the ground that lifts up to reveal a tank--and finds it empty. He leaves and comes back with a few gallons of a silver liquid and pours it in, before closing back the hatch. The light goes on. You ask what is that and he looks around confused. &quot;The silibrium?&quot; You nod. &quot;You don't use it at your house...?&quot; You shake your head and say no, what is it? He explains that it is a fuel that serves as Wonderland's primary energy source. Even other countries use it. He looks at you distrustfully and tells you you're a very strange girl, before leaving.\n\n[[An awkward dinner]]</div><div tiddler="Go to the elder again" tags="" created="201212311306" modifier="twee" twine-position="198,430">You're at Elder Meekly's place. The door is ajar. Depending on your personality, you either knock and think no one is there before hesitantly entering or you just walk in. You see him inside pouring silver liquid into a device. He closes the device and turns it on. It works. He notices you and says hi. You ask what he poured into the device. He explains that it is silibrium, which is a fuel that is found especially concentrated in Eba. You look confused when he says Eba, and he explains that is where they are right now. Everything in Eba is powered by silibrium and their society depends on it. He is grateful for that blessing from Mother Gaia. You still look really confused because you've never heard of silibrium. So he explains that it is used in other places, too. The country, Terovius, depends on silibrium and has been importing it so far from Arenia (&quot;your country&quot; if you lied to him).\n\nYou ask questions about the village. He tells you about how the village is ruled by the chief, who is elected. The elders are there to advise the chief but he doesn't have to listen. He mentions that there is a new chief with a daughter your age but the chief likes to do things his own way and doesn't take advice. He seems to say this with a lot of spite. You guess neither the chief nor his daughter is likable. He says he has to get back to work now but it was nice talking to you. As a souvenir, he gives you some of the silibrium. &quot;It's good to always have some on you.

Elai asks what she has the staff for and you tell him Anang wants to become a warrior. Elai laughs skeptically. &quot;That girl?&quot; He grabs the staff and does a fancy twirl with it. &quot;I bet she doesn't even know how to hold it.&quot; Anang tries to grab the staff back. &quot;All you can do with a staff is fancy twirls, I bet!&quot; Then Elai breaks a thin tree with the staff. Anang is now begging him to make her his apprentice. You think to yourself that Anang will apparently ask anyone to be her teacher\n\nElai shows Anang a few things with the staff and then they decide to take a break. He takes three pastries out of his knapsack and gives two to you. He brought one extra for you, which is why he got three pastries instead of two pastries. He starts eating one himself when Anang is like, &quot;What the hell?!&quot; You say, &quot;Come, come, you can have one of mine&quot;, just trying to keep the peace. Anang agrees, but only because it already belongs to you and not Elai.\n\nA week later, it is time for Anang's initiation ceremony. The chief and his daughter are there. Anang passes the test. There were a few kinks but it was overall good. The chief's daughter is suspicious. Afterwards, she questions Anang about how she got so good so fast. Anang gets really nervous and is a poor liar. This doesn't lessen Katori's suspicion. \n\nAs you and Anang meet with Elai, you get a feeling like you're being watched. One day, in the middle of a conversation with Elai, Anang suddenly shoves a tree really hard. Out of the tree fall Katori and her lackey. &quot;I knew it,&quot; Anang declares. &quot;If it isn't Katori and her lackey Chardon.&quot; Katori shakes her head, and says, &quot;No, /I/ knew it.&quot; She knew there was funny business going on. Chardon agrees. Elai complains that suddenly you are bringing over the whole town. You argue that you didn't bring anyone over. Katori is scandalized that Anang is stooping so low as to even hang out with a Chiquay. You defend the Chiquay people and Anang agrees, which shocks everyone, including her. Katori calls her a traitor and threatens to tell her father, which you and Anang strongly object to. Katori asks, well, what's in it for her (and Chardon agrees). You tell her that this side has lots of different foods, plants, and people. &quot;What about boys?&quot; Chardon asks. Everyone looks at her. She begins to feel embarrassed. &quot;Well, I thought it was a good question.&quot; Surprisingly, Katori agrees that it was. She says that all the boys on her side of the river are very boring and she has always been interested in Elai's kind. Elai objects to the way she's talking about his tribe like they are animals and he doesn't want to help her. Over his protests, Katori demands to be taken to the town square. \n\nOnce there, she sees an attractive boy and asks to be set up with him. Elai asks why he should do that and Chardon says he knows why. Elai bites his tongue and grabs your wrist hard. &quot;Should we go through with this?&quot;\n\n[[It's all we can do, right?]]\n[[No way in hell.]]</div><div tiddler="The traitor is Theo" tags="" created="201401200222" modifier="twee" twine-position="1428,6174">&quot;What?&quot; Theo says, quickly turning to face you. &quot;You have absolutely no evidence for that, do you?&quot;\n\nAck.

After work, Madison's dad comes by one night and he greets you curtly as Madison lets him in. He says that he needs to speak to both Madison and March. They go into Madison's office and Madison asks that you bring by something for his dad to eat. When you come with some tea and biscuits, you hear Madison's dad informing them that Lapis is doing really well lately, so the Queen has decided that it needs to be taxed more as a result. However, the tax she leverages on it is more than 100% of the company's yearly income. Madison's dad goes on about how Madison has always been a bit of a let down to him but March is like a son to him and he knows he'll make a great president to Lapis one day. March expresses doubt that he'll ever be able to do that but Madison's dad says March is young but he has a good head on his shoulders and he'll mature eventually and be a good businessman and leader. March remarks suddenly that he needs to use the bathroom and before you realize what's happening, he opens the door. You nearly drop the tray that you should've been returning to the kitchen. &quot;Hear anything interesting lately?&quot; March teases. In the room, Madison's dad says that actually, he should be on his way now and thanks for the tea and biscuits. Madison's dad leaves without noticing you, and Madison follows him out, seeing you and March. March tells him that it looks like their Allison will make a great spy one day. Madison asks in a flat tone what were you eavesdropping on now. You admit that you heard that Lapis is going to be taxed out of existence. Madison says yes, he's surprised the Queen would do that to a company she ought to love. You ask what he means by that. He explains that the Queen really likes the comics that come on the back of Lapis cookies. You start walking towards the kitchen and say that maybe they could stage a play of it for the Queen. March thinks the idea is hilarious and loves it. He insists that you try it. Madison says that come to think of it there is presedence for that working. The president over at Victor &amp; Roy was about to be imprisoned for something worthy such as embezellment but then they put on that ridiculous parade and the queen dropped all charges. You reluctantly agree.\n\nThe next day at work, March tells Camille that they're in need of actors and Camille of course is immediately on board. You start researching these comics and preparing a script. You randomly remember how diligently you prepared when you were starting your makeup guru channel. But oddly enough you try to recall your mothers face and draw nothing but a fuzzy blob. March designs creative costume adaptations of the animal characters. Camille helps with sewing.

And here's why. You told me you're the chef for the queen. And you like organic chemistry. The science of characteristics and reactions between organic materials.

It would be remiss of you as the queen's chef and a chemistry buff to not be able to poison any of her enemies as they sit down for dinner.

He has to be prepared to answer questions in his line of work. He says this turned out to be a dead end, so he'll be on his way now but you stop him. You tell him to come back in a week. You and Lonnie will convince Chess by then. He just nods and tells you to have a good day before leaving.\n\nFor the next couple of days, you try to work up the nerve to bring up the subject with Chess, but you never quite do. You always see Chess and Lonnie disappearing into some room, and you can tell that they probably don't want you following them. One day, Sophie is vacuuming the rooms and needs Chess and Lonnie to move the furniture so she can vacuum under it She tells you to go find them. You know the last time you saw them, they told you bye and went into that room. But you can't go in there... So you check around the hotel and make sure they aren't anywhere.\n\nAt last, you walk to the door and look at it expectantly. You don't want to go in. So you hope that one of them will come out soon. You intend to give it five minutes, but you're already uneasy in 30 seconds. You gently knock on the door. No one answers. You knock harder. There's no answer still. Feeling very nervous, you ease the door open.\n\nIt's a cellar. You had no idea the inn had a cellar. Trying not to make noise, you step onto the stairs and close the door back lightly before continuing down. It's dark--there's some lighting but it's pretty dim. You reach the bottom. It takes a while for your eyes to adjust but you finally make out Chess and Lonnie sitting at a table. A sad 80s power ballad is playing softly. There's trash everywhere and posters or flyers on the wall, as well as a drawing board. Chess and Lonnie seem to be discussing some annoying guest from a few days ago. \n\n&quot;Um, hey, guys.&quot; Chess and Lonnie jump about a foot. &quot;Sorry for coming down here... but Sophie told me to come find you guys because she's vacuuming and she wants...&quot; \n\n&quot;Whatever you needed us for could've waited until we came back,&quot; Chess says a little harshly. He slurs his words.\n\n&quot;Well, I was waiting but no one was coming to the door! I even knocked and...&quot; You notice a bottle in Chess's hand and put two and two together. &quot;... have you been drinking?&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; he says flatly, while downing the rest of his half empty bottle and going for another one.\n\nYou turn to a hunched over Lonnie for help. &quot;Lonnie, Sophie's gonna be mad if I can't get you guys to come up. So please just cooperate?&quot;\n\n&quot;Allison, we'll be up in a minute, okay?&quot; he promises. Instead of answering, you look around a little more at the trash that's everywhere. Most of it's paper. You observe the flyers a bit more closely but can't read in the dark so good. Finally, you see a photo on the ground and pick it up. \n\n&quot;Isn't this Sophie's daughter...?&quot;\n\nSilence hangs in the air. Chess and Lonnie look like they've been caught doing something dirty.\n\nChess starts on another bottle. &quot;Yes.&quot; He takes a swig. &quot;Noemie is her name.&quot;\n\n&quot;Was,&quot; you say automatically to yourself, but it looks like they both heard.\n\n&quot;I bet you've wondered how she died. After all, something had to kill her. People don't die so young. Right?&quot; He looks you straight in the eye, like he expects an answer, almost like he thinks you had something to do with it. It still doesn't sound like the type of question that should be answered, so you say nothing.\n\n&quot;The Queen had her executed.&quot; He makes a quick gesture across his neck and lets his head fall down. Off with her head, is what you get from it. Instantly, you get chills.\n\n&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; you say meaninglessly. &quot;Were you her... friends?&quot;\n\nChess says, &quot;Yeah.&quot; Lonnie is oddly silent. You're about to repeat that you're sorry but stop yourself halfway. Chess says he bets you are and gives you a challenging stare. You don't know what you're being challenged to. You can't meet his eyes for so long so you give reading one of the flyers another shot. It looks like... plans for gathering support?\n\n&quot;Why was she executed?&quot; you ask, your voice now firm.\n\n&quot;That's none of your business--&quot; Chess starts.\n\n&quot;It was no fault of her own,&quot; Lonnie answers. &quot;She didn't do anything.&quot; You sense there might be more to it than that.\n\n&quot;When was she executed again?&quot;\n\n&quot;A year ago,&quot; Lonnie says.\n\n&quot;And how many people have been executed for nothing since then?&quot; Neither responds at first. Then Lonnie says, &quot;I don't understand what you're saying. I don't know. What does that have to do with us--&quot;\n\n&quot;Everything! It has everything to do with you. You know what it's like, having a loved one torn from you, and yet you let it happen to countless other people.&quot; You gesture to a flyer. &quot;You knew what the right thing to do was--putting an end to this senseless murder. But eventually, you fell by the wayside. Couldn't be bothered, right? Couldn't be bothered to keep anybody else from dying. Why? Because they're not her? They're not Noe--&quot;\n\n&quot;Don't you dare say her name,&quot; Chess growls.\n\n&quot;Why not? It wouldn't be anymore in vain than it is now. You've already disgraced her name. How could you give up?&quot;\n\n&quot;What we do is...&quot;\n\n&quot;None of my business, but it's honestly sickening to watch. So here's an idea: stop drinking to your stupid old music and get up! Fight! Things don't have to be like this! It's too late for her and a lot of other people, but you can still save lives!&quot;\n\nWeakly, Chess says, &quot;I'm just one man.&quot;\n\nA little softer, you say &quot;No, you're not. You've got Lonnie right there. And you guys had perfectly sound plans for expanding. I just... can't believe you gave up.&quot; You sigh. &quot;Never mind. I'm going up.&quot;\n\nAs you're making your way up, Lonnie says &quot;I can't believe it either&quot; and you stop. &quot;We should've kept going. Even when no one wanted to join us, we should've dug deeper. I'm sorry we quit. So... what do you say, Chess?

She says sure and gives it to you, questioning. After you've been quickly flipping through it for a while, she asks who someone like you would need to call in the phonebook. You vaguely say that you're just checking some things out. You find the name of the brand on the box, Lapis, and go to the phone. Sophie follows you. You're about to start dialing when you realize you don't know how to use those phones. You stare at it blankly for a while and Sophie sighs. &quot;I'm guessing you don't know how to use a phone.&quot; You nod, a little ashamed. Sophie asks you which number you want to call. You show her and she tells you to watch carefully, and demonstrates how to dial before giving the phone back to you. They say this is Lapis Foods, how may I help you, and you ask if they could possibly list all Lapis locations around you. Confused, the customer service person says they aren't a store; the only locations they have are warehouses. You say that's fine, you are interested in knowing the locations of the warehouses. With a lot of doubt and suspicion in his voice, he says okay. You run to get a pen and paper and start writing them down. When he's finished, you thank him and hang up.\n\nSo you've narrowed it down (probably) to about 25 locations. Luckily, 8 are in one place. You find a big plastic shopping bag and load it up with some clothes, toiletries, a comb, and a brush. Then you double bag it. You have a feeling you won't be back for a while. You'll start at the place where they are clustered.\n\nYou think about writing a note explaining your absence to Sophie. But you don't know how long you'll be gone. You wouldn't want to say something like &quot;Thanks for everything&quot; if you were coming back the same night. But not writing anything might be too rude. So you write &quot;Leaving. - Allison&quot; with a happy face and head out.\n\nYou ask someone nearby about directions to the address, pointing to it on your sheet of paper. They tell you it's right off some street, which isn't very useful. You ask if they could possibly write directions for you, even though you're still a little nervous about directions. You take a deep breath and fold the paper over so you're only looking at the first line. Right. How do you read signs again? It's the one parallel to the street that's describing it... right? You walk to the intersection in front of you and take a left. You move the fold down to see the next direction. Go straight from there. \n\nMany hours later, you're at the last direction. Make a right. You're incredibly thirsty and you're starting to get hungry. But you finally see a row of warehouses with &quot;Lapis&quot; stenciled onto the fronts. If it's not any of these, you think... if it's not any of these, it's another whole long trek tomorrow. And maybe the day after that, too. And after that. What if it's not even a Lapis warehouse? What if it has nothing to do with Lapis?\n\nAll the warehouses' windows are boarded up and the doors are all bolted. If Chess and Lonnie are in any of these, it's a total fire hazard. Ignoring the stabs of hunger that are starting up, you reach up for a board at one of the windows and try to pry it off with your fingers. It hurts so you give up quickly. Why didn't you bring a hammer? You turn away from the window and hold your hands out in the moonlight. Red but not bleeding.\n\nThat's when you notice tracks in the dirt. They lead to one warehouse.  There's your hint. You walk to that warehouse and try to pull off the window again. It hurts a lot. No luck, as expected. You try the door. You push against it a little and nothing happens, as expected. You sigh, take a deep breath, back up, and ram against the door, tumbling down as the door falls forward, colliding with the floor and bumping along into an unflattering position. You look up and see Lonnie, who's looking at you in wordless, somewhat happy surprise. Chess behind him is in a stiff, offensive stance but his face is starting to take on a look of disbelief. A little further away is the guy who delivered the message, wearing a benign confused expression. Next to him is another guy a little shorter than Chess, whom you've never seen before (looking shocked, annoyed, and a little guilty all at once). You get the immediate impression that, despite his flamboyant taste in fashion, he is an adult, though he can't be much older than the others. It doesn't take long for them to figure out you're not a threat, so their eyes slowly turn to Chess who is looking more annoyed by the second. You turn your attention back to Lonnie. Your mind is flashing back to when he hugged you last time you saw him and it's sticking there. It feels like you haven't seen him in forever and he looks tired. You didn't do him any favors by suddenly showing up either, you realize.\n\n&quot;The note, right?&quot; Lonnie says with a wink. He wanted you to find them. The wink doesn't get past Chess.\n\n&quot;I knew sending the message was dangerous but I let you do it. Then you leave her a clue?&quot; Chess is steaming mad. &quot;What is going through your mind, Lonnie? You do realize it's our lives that are at stake with your little games, don't you?&quot; He has gripped Lonnie's shoulders tightly and forced him to face him. &quot;Anyone could have intercepted that note and tracked us down.&quot;\n\nLightheartedly, Lonnie jokes, &quot;No one in the Queen's army was smart enough to figure it out.&quot;\n\nYou think to yourself that it wasn't a matter of smarts but luck. &quot;You guys left tracks,&quot; you mumble. &quot;Outside the door, there were footprints. I don't know if it matters much, but I could easily narrow down which warehouse was occupied.&quot; Everyone's looking at you.\n\nChess roughly pushes Lonnie away. &quot;Right. We'll clear those up right away.&quot;\n\nThe warehouse is big and barren, except for one corner, which has some papers and snack wrappers.\n\nThe guy in the top hat speaks up. &quot;I apologize for the state of disarray. We weren't expecting any female guests,&quot; he says with a little smile. &quot;My name is Madison Spelling. How do you do.&quot; He extends his hand and you shake it.\n\n&quot;I'm fine,&quot; you respond, but he looks at you weird. Guess that wasn't a question.\n\n[[In the Warehouse (Lonnie)]]\n[[In the Warehouse (Chess)]]</div><div tiddler="Morning actions" tags="" created="201212311436" modifier="twee" twine-position="12,431">&lt;&lt;actions &quot;Go to the elder again&quot; \n&quot;Go just outside Anang's house&quot; \n&quot;Go explore&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;if $eldertalk and $AnangsMom and $exploration&gt;&gt;[[Retire to Anang's house]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Go explore" tags="" created="201212311255" modifier="twee" twine-position="524,392">You look around the village.

Everyone is glaring at them. &lt;&lt;if $eldertalk&gt;&gt;You get the feeling that's the chief and his daughter.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;You continue to walk amongst the houses on the upper level's walkways and eventually descend the stairs back to the ground. You walk a little further, past their little settlement. On the ground you find an old folded-up piece of paper. You unfold it and discover it's a map. Folding it again, you put it in your pocket to look at later.\n\nWalking back to Anang's house, you happen to overhear a conversation. Some crops have gone missing, a man complains. In whispered tones, he says &quot;Must be the Chiquay.&quot;(The Chiquay is the other tribe.)

You can't put distance between yourself and Madison fast enough and he sees you.\n\n&quot;Allison? What are you doing here?&quot;\n\n&quot;Uh, I was...&quot; You look down at the forgotten cupcake in your hand. &quot;I was looking for you!&quot; and you shove it towards him. \n\nHe gives the cupcake at most a quick glance before turning his attention back to you. &quot;You shouldn't be this far from the kitchen. That is where you are assigned to work, not out here.&quot; But he sees your guilty look and seems to let it go for the time being. &quot;Irresponsibility aside...&quot; He takes the cupcake gingerly in his hands. &quot;... for me?&quot;\n\nYou nod. &quot;I wanted to say thanks for yesterday. Although I know I'm not a high class baker like you.&quot;\n\nHe dabs his little finger in the frosting and tastes it thoughtfully, before taking a little bite. &quot;Hm. I'm no patissier but this certainly has potential. I see special attention was paid to the presentation.&quot; He looks pointedly at the golden star. Good thing you didn't put a heart after all. &quot;Have you tasted it?&quot; You shake your head. &quot;I'll save half for you, then. Thank you, Allison.&quot; He looks genuinely pleased. You leave and go back to the kitchen.\n\nWhat was that room? And what was he doing in there?

Madison says that's not necessary and he's not about to start charging a child room and board. You say you're 17 and will be turning 18 in a few months. He says, &quot;so you're a child in other words.&quot; You start to protest but he says, &quot;I may be able to get you a job at the palace.

He gets confused and asks where NY is, you say America, he says where? You realize you are really far from home. He sees your scared expression and offers you a place to stay. You're welcome to stay with them until you can figure something out. \n\nAnang looks tragically hurt. &quot;You lied to me...?&quot;  You explain that you were confused at the time and didn't know what to do. She is disappointed because she wanted to be your apprentice and she goes on to explain why. You reach her house. You lie in the bed and worry about if your parents are looking for you or if they've called the police. You worry until you run out of thoughts and fall asleep, noticing you still feel really dizzy and light.\n\nThe next morning, Anang is brooding, probably about you lying to her on the way to the village from before. You say something like &quot;I have to go somewhere&quot; vaguely and escape from the house.\n\n&lt;&lt;display &quot;Morning actions&quot;&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Work with March the next day" tags="" created="201406090232" modifier="twee" twine-position="2100,1520">The next day, you try working with March. You go to work with March. You work as Lapis's sign holder advertiser for one of their stores in town. You are pretty bored the whole day. You're pretty sure that not one soul was attracted due to your efforts. After work March brings you a snack from the company. There is a prize at the bottom. You say something profound and he is impressed. Camille comes by the store and gets jealous. March obviously knows her and seems even to be amused by her. He says she comes to the food store everyday to buy that same snack. Camille says she really loves it. But you have the sneaking suspicion that while the snack is in fact delicious thats not all she comes there for. Camille buys 12 boxes of the snack when she sees March giving you attention but declines March's offer to carry them. March tells you to pack up the advertisement stuff and put it away. He then leaves saying he'll see you at home.\n\nWhen he leaves you see Camille struggling and you offer to help her carry the stuff.Camille is surprised and starts asking you a million questions about how you know March and what does he mean by see you at home. You say that you're staying at his house. She asks if youre his girl friend but she doesnt wait for you to reply quickly dismissing the idea. She doesnt give her reason but you're still mildly offended. She introduces herself as Camille. You notice that her way of speaking is a little more rough sounding now that March is gone.  You offer one last time to help her and she looks like she briefly considers it but says no thanks and hurries away. You notice that she's forgotten a few boxes. You take it upon yourself to help yourself.

And coincidentally, you're one of the top scientific minds in the government when it comes to chemistry. I don't want to say this. But what if it's you?

After a period of silence, you go to sleep.\n\nWhen you wake up, Anang is already gone. She has to go train with the other warriors.

So then you force yourself to remain calm. This is probably nothing, right? Just stand still.\n\nKota walks in and everyone looks incredulously from him to March. Kota tells March that he got his message and March says duh. Realization dawns and Chess says that March contacted Kota and Kota says yeah, he left a message in his house. You're looking around absently and notice someone peeking through the window briefly and get scared all over again. &quot;Uh, guys, I think we're being watched.&quot;\n\nMarch nods. &quot;Yeah, I'm getting to that.&quot;\n\n&quot;No... I think we're being watched, like, right now...&quot; You glance back at the window and see no one there--\n\nThe warehouse door slams open and two kids your age who appear to be confident except for their shaking legs step in.\n\n&quot;I am Elai of the Tribe of Chiquay...&quot;\n\n&quot;and I am Warrior Anang of the proud Hautain people of Eba...&quot; Elai shoots her a quick distressed look but the look is quickly gone.\n\n&quot;And we are here to join the rebellion!&quot; They say together finally.\n\nYou look at them skeptically. &quot;...what?&quot;\n\nMadison asks for an explanation and Kota says with frustration that it's his little brother and a girl from the neighboring tribe and they stowed away in his car. Again. Kota says he has no idea why they keep doing it and they say they said they want to join the rebellion. Kota says the rebellion's not a place for kids and Elai says &quot;Then why's she here?&quot;, gesturing towards you. You bristle. Chess looks at him accusingly and Kota responds not to worry, they're going back home right now. March says that's the thing. They can't. You see, when March went to Kota's house, he just wanted to talk to him but he noticed that Kota's house was under surveillance. So it would probably be best for all of them to lay low for now, because they could be in danger. Madison nods to that and Chess grunts. Now what's weird, March says, is that they didn't keep watching him once he left the house. He thinks there may be a traitor among them. Chess says that it's possible that it's just some sort of trap and that that's a lot to assume. Lonnie agrees and Madison says nothing but folds his arms. Chess says that there's no point in deliberating about this if they're not even certain it's true.\nSo, for Kota, Chess repeats the plan. They are going to replace the silibrium supply of the Queen's area of the castle with fake silibrium. This will leave the area without power, allowing them to get close to the Queen. Kota asks how they're going to make fake silibrium but Chess says it's already been done. It's located in another warehouse. March grins sheepishly and apologizes to everyone for not mentioning it. Elai asks how they're going to get the silibrium inside the castle and everyone gives him a dubious and/or dirty look. Chess responds that the person who is delivering the fake silibrium to the castle is the person who used to deliver food to the inn. Anang asks how they're going to get them to use the fake silibrium instead of theirs. Chess says that the maintenance person at the castle doesn't like the Queen and Chess already convinced him to join their side. Any more questions? You shake your head. &quot;Then we should be good to go,&quot; he said finally. &quot;We need to meet with our contact in the castle tonight and make sure the plan's set in stone.\n\n[[Chess's path: plan details]]\n[[Other path: plan details]]\n</div><div tiddler="Some time with Lonnie" tags="" created="201310060040" modifier="twee" twine-position="1044,3925">You're bored out of your mind and regret not taking the deck of cards with you.

Has time passed in the real world since you've disappeared or not? You say you don't know. Probably not. Lonnie is confused. Then, gently, &quot;You're not native to Wonderland, are you?&quot;\n\nYou shake your head. He considers something. &quot;Why did you come here?&quot; You say it wasn't your choice. He says, okay, how did you come here?\n\n[[I'm from a neighboring country.]]\n[[I'm from another world.]]\n[[I can't tell you.]]\n[[I don't know.]]</div><div tiddler="Don't tell me what to do" tags="" created="201311082329" modifier="twee" twine-position="803,4529">You tell him, &quot;Don't tell me what to do&quot; and he says sorry but his plans and the rebellion are none of your business and never will be.\n\n[[Chess and Lonnie's departure]]</div><div tiddler="Another way" tags="" created="201306100356" modifier="twee" twine-position="333,3824">You ask Anang carefully if there's another way to the Chiquay side. She flinches. &quot;You still want to go back?&quot; You shake your head instintively. &quot;No. I mean, yes. I have to get back home and Elai's brother is going to be there tomorrow. You'll show me another way over, won't you?&quot;\n\nAnang won't say anything. Insistently, you touch her shoulder and meet her eyes. You tell her that you have to get home at all costs, as soon as possible. Your family is probably worried sick and probably already filed a missing person report. They could think you're dead, maybe your friends think so, too. Connor has probably started some rumor about why you're missing. But Anang isn't looking you in the eyes anymore so you just leave the room.\n\nThe next day, when you wake up, you hear Anang's mom and brother talking about how Anang said she wasn't going to the warrior meeting today. You think that's strange. You stand up and nearly slip on a sheet of paper on the ground next to your bed. It says for you to meet up at a certain place and it is signed with Anang's name. So you go there and Anang is there. Anang tells you to follow her and you do. You follow her a long way until you reach a secluded looking area. You look at the river and see a bunch of rocks in the rushing water. &lt;&lt;if $understodanang&gt;&gt;&quot;I knew I could count on you! But...&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You look properly at the bridge. &quot;...uh, is this how I'm supposed to get across?&quot;\n\nShe nods.\n\n&quot;This can't possibly be safe.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, it's your only chance of getting across.&quot; Insensitively, Anang darts ahead, skillfully leaping across each rock to the other side. She looks at you expectantly.\n\nTentatively, you stretch your foot to step onto the first stone. It's big and wasn't very far into the water. But you're more than a little hesitant to go to the next stone. It's farther and one slip could be fatal. You barely manage to step onto that one. You look out and realize that there's no way you can stretch your way onto that one. You look at Anang. You jump and land surely onto this stone. The next one is just as far as this one was, but just a little smaller. You've got the hang of this though, right? You jump but this time you're not as lucky. You land on the stone but it's wet and slippery like the rest of them and your foot slips. You can hear Anang yelling your name and you go under a little, immediately being carried away. You can't see, your eyes sting, you're bobbing up, coughing, trying to get a clear breath. You hear a splash and someone who is trying to swim against the current is holding you. As you both bob above the water, you realize it's Elai, yelling at you to swim. You try to swim against the current too but it's too hard. You're just about out of energy when a man's voice from the other side of the river yells &quot;Idiot! Catch this!&quot; You and Elai grab the thing being thrown, which turns out to be a thick rope. You notice a Chiquay-looking man and Anang are both tugging you and Elai to shore with all their strength. Finally you two make it. The man admonishes Elai for jumping into the water despite him telling him not to, then notices you can hear him. He smiles. &quot;Nice to meet you. I'm Elai's older brother, Kota.&quot;\n\nLater, you and Elai are getting dried off at Evea's house and Kota's making tea for you. Anang is sitting at the table clasping her hands quietly. Kota says he didn't catch your names and you and Anang tell him them. Then, to you, he off-handedly mentions that he doesn't usually see people like you around here--in Wonderland maybe, but not Eba. You agree. Kota asks if you're by any chance Arenian. You say no. Kota casually repeats that they don't get too many visitors from outside of Eba out here... could you possibly be from Olvene? You say no. Kota stops what he is doing and turns around. &quot;Alright, where exactly are you from and why are you here?&quot; \n\nElai answers roughly &quot;Somewhere very far away. How is that tea coming along?&quot;\n\nKota raises his eyebrow but says it's finished and gives a cup to you and Elai. He places a cup in front of Anang, but not before saying, in a lighthearted tone, &quot;Don't forget to give that back when you're done.&quot; Then addressing Elai, he says, &quot;Speaking of which, who's your Hautain friend here?&quot;\n\nElai starts answering. &quot;This is--&quot;\n\nAnang cuts him off. &quot;I'm Anang,&quot; she says, somewhat forcefully.\n\n&quot;And I see you're a warrior?&quot;\n\nAnang confirms it, proudly stating her official rank. Kota asks how they all came to be together. Elai explains that Allison saved Elai one time, crossed to the other side, and Anang sorta was a package deal with Allison, and then the village chief's daughter started wanting to come along, and Wes got a crush on her, and now they're trying to get the two tribes back together but it looks like Anang was trying to bring a Chiquay generator to the Hautain side and someone found out and burnt the tree bridge, so Allison and Anang were trying to get across via the rocks in the water. Kota says that as a diplomat he understands what they're trying to do and why, and that in times like this, the tribes can't afford to fight each other anymore and should be uniting instead. However, he doesn't think you guys are going about it the right way and doesn't think you kids should be worrying about something like this. He says he admittedly can't stay with you too long but he thinks that his rope could come in handy and he can always buy another one, so he gives it to Anang. \n\n[[Another way 2]]</div><div tiddler="Getting away with Chess" tags="" created="201306230329" modifier="twee" twine-position="1058,1277">They're already closing the gap between you, though. The soldier from before forcefully tilts Chess's face up so that he can get a better look at it. &quot;Chess...?&quot; he says, surprised. Chess simply states back, &quot;Rufus&quot; before giving him a hard punch in the glasses much to the shock of both Rufus and his companion and running away with you.\n\n&quot;What the hell just happened?!&quot; you demand of Chess while running. He doesn't answer. Instead, he makes a bunch of random turns into alleys and back roads. It starts raining and you're cold. He continues running like this until you tell him you can't run anymore. Or even stand for that matter. He says, looking a little remorseful, that he thinks he's lost them now and you're about to respond when you both hear voices and see another light aimed in your direction. It starts to rain harder. He pulls you out of view from the end of the alley, next to a dumpster and very close to him. He covers your mouth, which is good because you let out a little sound of surprise. You hear Rufus and the other guy arguing about whether or not to just forget this all and go home. Rufus complains that he's tired, it's raining, and his face seriously hurts. He's lucky that his eyes came out of that altercation totally in tact, he goes on. The other guy says he needs to stop whining because if that really is Chesley then catching him will be enough to pay for not only every pain reliever he wants, but a new face and a nice life in retirement. Rufus says that he knows it was Chess because he heard him call him Rufus. Anyway, Rufus continues, if they're going to keep this up, then they should at least check the alley Chess really went down... which was, like he said, the next one. They move on, the other guy more reluctantly. \n\nAfter waiting a few seconds, Chess suddenly releases you and he heaves a sigh of relief as you gasp for air. Maybe it's time to go back, he says with a tiny smile. You agree. Walking back to the inn, it starts to rain super hard so you run under the cover of a storefront. You comment that you never got to find out what flavor the jello lake was. Chess says it's fruit punch. You look at him. His face is totally straight. You ask him how he knows. He says the Queen made the soldiers turn the lake into jello when he was in the military. You look at him with surprise. &quot;You used to be a soldier?!&quot; He nods. You ask how come he never told you? He shrugs and says he barely knows you and that, frankly, there are a lot of things you haven't told him, too. Aren't there? So you shut up. You make fun of how Chess is a lot harder to take serious when he's soaking wet like this, and Chess comments that he hates rain. The rain has gotten lighter, so you take advantage of this and try to run back to the inn while the rain's still relatively light.\n\nBy the time you reach the inn, you're both totally soaked. Lonnie was waiting for you. He asks you why you guys stayed out till it started raining and where you guys went anyway. You're too tired to answer Lonnie, so you just shake your head hoping he'll understand that, and head upstairs to your room. Chess just says &quot;Same old, same old,&quot; and leaves the room.\n\nOnce you're on your bed, you reflect on the fact that Chess used to be in the military and wonder what that was like for him. You also reflect on the fact that there's even a Queen and a jello lake. You've never seen something so strange. You know there's no country like this. No European Anglophone one, anyway, like this one looks like it should be. There are no vacuums like the ones here, either. It's hard to accept. But you're far from home. Very far. \n\nSo far you're not even in the same world anymore. \n\n[[Meeting Kota]]</div><div tiddler="Reserved Allison: Play Time" tags="" created="201501040044" modifier="twee" twine-position="2175,3012">So you guys have finalized the play.

In the interest of saving his families company he arranges something with a Seer he knows named Theo. They go and perform for the queen. Its all actually quite strange and it doesn't seem real. It your first time in the palace and your first time meeting the queen. Everyone says she's crazy and evil but when you meet her she seems almost personable and funny. Then you perform and everything is going well and you're feeling good but you fight down the urge to adlib just in case. At the end the queen suddenly looks furious. She gets angry and announces that she doesn't like how Camille's character treated March's character. She orders her imprisoned for life.\n\n\nYou think she must be joking and realise too late that she is very serious. She has Camille locked into the dungeon and then has you guys thrown out of the castle. You feel extremely guilty and you cry. March says something to you about the rebellion and one of the people throwing you out happens to overhear. \n\n[[Ransacked]]</div><div tiddler="Go outside v2" tags="" created="201706280425" modifier="twee" twine-position="1979,5450">You're making your way to the door and when you reach it, Madison is coming in.

You say she was fine. You ask the mom about the company that makes the snack and the mom says it's Lapis. You hastily explain that it looked good, so you wanted to buy some yourself to try it.

So you get up on the table and close the window back. You start putting the scraps of paper in the trash when you find the photo of Noemie. It's too big for your pants pocket but you suddenly have the brilliant idea to put it in the back pocket, where it fits a lot better. You notice a pair of boxers on the ground. Crap. You pick it up and struggle to quickly figure out what to do with it.  There's a knocking on the door and it subsequently opens. You freeze. &quot;I'm going down whether you like it or not,&quot; Rufus says to Sophie as he walks down the stairs, his men following. Sophie is behind him, looking reluctant and annoyed all at once. &quot;You again,&quot; Rufus says almost amicably when he sees you. &quot;And why are you down here, by your lonesome?&quot; You notice that his tone is much more professional than the last time you'd seen him, in the rain talking to the other soldier.\n\n&quot;I'm just...  picking things up around here.&quot;\n\n&quot;No broom or vacuum? Mop? Polish?&quot;\n\n&quot;This is my room. I'm just picking things up,&quot; you say defensively, a little unsure.\n\n&quot;And the boxers in your hands?&quot;\n\nYour face turns red. &quot;They're my boyfriend's, thank you.&quot;\n\nRufus turns just as red as you. &quot;A-ah, right.&quot;\n\n&quot;Are you done harrassing my employee now?&quot; Sophie interjects.\n\n&quot;No, actually.&quot; Rufus squints at you. &quot;Your employee... You're the girl who was with Chesley that night!&quot; Your heart skips a beat in a really bad way. &quot;Under the authority of her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts, you are under...&quot;\n\n&quot;No!&quot; says one of the soldiers suddenly. &quot;If you bring in something other than what she wanted... don't you think the Queen will have us all executed?&quot; The other soldiers nod and exchanged worried glances. Rufus stiffens and says that's certainly a possibility. He breathes in and out slowly and says to you, finally, that your little lie wasn't funny and that if he ever sees or hears the slightest sign of suspicious activity going on here, this establishment will be over. He stomps up the stairs and the other soldiers follow.\n\nA little while after, you and Sophie also head up. You see a broken picture frame with a picture of Sophie and Noemie.\n\nSophie sees it, too. She kneels down and starts to pick up the pieces. The atmosphere in the whole inn is strangely heavier now that Chess and Lonnie are gone. The few guests that were at the inn hadn't come from their rooms. One thing was for sure: even the mention of the Queen's army sent people running in the other direction.\n\nSophie is quiet. Then she says, &quot;They can't come back here. Not for a long time.&quot; She shakes her head and sighs.\n\n&quot;I'm sure it won't be too long.&quot; You look at the photo again. &quot;Um, hey... can I ask you... How did Chess, Lonnie, and Noemie get along?&quot;\n\n&quot;They were on and off. Noemie met Chess when they were both young. I don't know what happened with his parents, if they died or not. The people of the town took turns taking care of him, but he always came to my inn wherever he was and he'd hang around with Noemie.\n\n&quot;When Chess decided to join the military I was against it. He wanted to do it so I wouldn't have to worry about taking care of him. I told him I didn't care but he insisted and I couldn't convince him otherwise. He and Lonnie were in the same unit and they got to know each other. On breaks, he and Lonnie came back to the inn and Lonnie started hanging out with Noemie, too. The three got along great somedays. And the other days, they'd be at each other's throats. Personally, I tried to stay out of it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then last year, she was executed. I was called to collect her body from the town square. Chess and Lonnie went missing for a few weeks before they showed up at the inn, begging me to earn their keep and live here. So I let them.&quot;\n\n&quot;I've got just one question, though. Why was Noemie executed?&quot;\n\n&quot;As if the Queen needed a reason.&quot; She scoffs. &quot;The Queen does as she wishes.&quot;\n\nYou don't buy it.\n\n&quot;Maybe. But I think, even when there's no reason, that there's always a cause for someone's actions. So what set her off?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nothing. And even if something did set her off, it has nothing to do with you.&quot; She deposits the shards of glass in the nearest garbage. &quot;Now, we're not gonna waste time on the past all day. Go check on the guests, let them know everything's alright, and clean up the mess those military idiots made. Now that Chess and Lonnie are gone, we're going to have to work twice as hard.&quot;\n\nYou know that Sophie is holding something back but now isn't the time to interrogate her. You hope Chess and Lonnie can come back soon. \n\n[[Back to work]]\n</div><div tiddler="Other path: plan details" tags="" created="201311082335" modifier="twee" twine-position="1146,4430">You ask Chess and Lonnie if they're going to be okay.

He gets you a job in the kitchen as a dish washer. You break one of the dishes. He comes over, checks your wound, and puts antiseptic on it. You try to man through it even though it hurts like a female dog. He puts a bandage on it for you. He tells a funny joke (not on purpose). He has a cool air of sophistication around him but he is subtly quite funny. He has his own work to do but you have a feeling that he's making time for you to come over whenever he can, and you enjoy your day there with him heading home in good spirits if not slightly pruned.\n\nShe meets Theo at the castle. During her lunch break she has to fight all the urges not to explore the castle. She was warned firmly by Madison that she must not leave the kitchen because anything could upset the queen and bring on her wrath. But Theo comes to the kitchen to sneak a snack. He immediately takes a liking to her. He tells her about the seers and she tells him about her story and how she ended up in Wonderland. He says he believes her but she isn't sure if he's playing along.\n\n[[Who to work with]]</div><div tiddler="Ransacked" tags="" created="201501040051" modifier="twee" twine-position="2114,3346">The next day you are woken up by the house being ransacked. March and Madison sneak in through a window to get you. They're trying to decide which one of them will try to sneak around the military to try to take the paper evidence of their plans (plans for what? you don't know) and which one will take you to the warehouse that they plan to escape to. \n\n[[I feel more comfortable with March]]\n[[I feel more comfortable with Madison]]\n</div><div tiddler="Introduction" tags="" created="201308242013" modifier="twee" twine-position="1032,3428">&quot;Name's March,&quot; he says with a lopsided grin and a goofy bow. &quot;Yes, the one, the only March Harrison, at your service!&quot;\n\nChess turns to Lonnie, ignoring the introductions going on. &quot;So what, Lonnie? Was there really no logic behind you getting Allison to come here? Were you planning on using her as a messenger? Because she'll only be another a liability--&quot;\n\nLonnie smiles. &quot;No logic. That's the honest truth.&quot;\n\nChess makes a frustrated noise. &quot;Well, she is going to have to learn how to take care of herself.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean 'take care of herself?'&quot; Lonnie says defensively. &quot;Are you going to teach her how to fight then?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, because she is your responsibility, not mine,&quot; Chess says.\n\n&quot;Uh, fight? I don't fight. Isn't it okay if I just clean up around here or something...&quot;\n\nChess fixes you with a glare and says &quot;We don't need a maid around here, if that's what you're suggesting.&quot; That sure shut you up.\n\n&quot;I could think of more than a few creative uses for a maid,&quot; March quips. &quot;She is leaving,&quot; Chess says with irritation. &quot;Now.&quot;\n\nMadison interjects. &quot;At this time of night? A young lady walking alone in the dark...&quot;\n\n&quot;Then she'll be harder to detect,&quot; Chess interrupts.\n\nLonnie frowns and says he agrees with Madison that it isn't safe for you. Chess looks at March expectantly and March sighs, saying that he agrees too. Chess says that you're leaving first thing tomorrow morning then. You set your plastic bag down (Chess glares at it and at the fact that you brought a bag in the first place) and lie down on the hard wooden floor, laying your head down onto the bag. March notices you and offers you his arm as a pillow. You say, &quot;Uh, no thanks.&quot; He says suit yourself and then they all go over to a bunch of crates and sit on them and start to discuss a plan. You try to pay attention but you're so tired you just end up falling asleep.\n\nThe next morning, Chess wakes you up and says you have to leave so you do. On the way back, Rufus and his men intercept you and arrest you. You are handcuffed. (Meanwhile, March comes back from the inn to the warehouse and reports to Chess, Lonnie, and Madison that Sophie said that Rufus came by after Allison left the inn, looking for her. She wasn't there so now she's wanted.) \n\nChess, Lonnie, and the others catch up with you a moment after. They try to convince Rufus to let you go, saying that you're innocent (to which Rufus refutes that you can't be too innocent if you're with them). He almost starts to listen to them but then stops himself. He announces that you're all under arrest. He also recognizes Madison and wonders what the heck a diplomat is doing with them and calls him a traitor. Madison puts on a good act about being one of the good guys. But eventually Rufus is like enough of this and tells some of his men to stop wasting time and to go and bring the car. \n\nThe guys are then all handcuffed and sitting on the edge of the road when Rufus, Lonnie, and Chess have some more back story time. During this you notice that March has manages to slip out of one of his handcuffs. You had just been about to accept defeat. You're the only one to notice and he notices you noticing. He winks and you suddenly realize that maybe you guys do have a chance to escape. Thinking quickly you hop up and use your flexibility to bring your arms to the front and pick up a rock and throw it at Rufus. It hits his glasses and one of the lens cracks. He has a mental breakdown. His guys quickly grab hold of you while you thrash around. You even manage to kick one of them in there nether region. During the scuffle you've managed to distract them long enough to give March a chance to get Chess free and they're able to over power the three guys who stayed (including Rufus with his impaired vision) and knock them out. March gets the others out of their handcuffs and puts the handcuffs on Rufus's guys and Madison suggests staying off the roads to evade them when they wake up. \n\nSo you all head into the forests. A few hours later, Lonnie says the coast is probably clear, so they should start heading back. You point out that Chess wanted you to go back to the inn, but Chess looks at you with irritation and says that's clearly not an option anymore because Rufus is looking for you and has already looked at the inn. The safest place there is, he admits, is with them. So you all head back to the warehouse. \n\nThere, everyone sits on the crates and discusses what their immediate next option is. Lonnie suggests changing locations. After all, Rufus isn't stupid. He saw the direction you were coming from, and there's only two things that way: warehouses and forest. Madison shakes his head, suggesting that you all just stay there. It will take too long for the military to ascertain the exact warehouse they're in. By the time the military finds them, they will have already seen them coming. It's not like they have anywhere else to go. March cuts in that that's not true, there are plenty of other warehouses they could go to around the country. March is already packing his things up. He says he doesn't plan on getting caught. &quot;Do you?&quot; He looks each of you straight in the eye. When he looks at you, you feel compelled to shake your head no and start blabbering about how you absolutely don't want to get caught at all. &quot;Right,&quot; he says, and goes back to packing. &quot;So we're moving north.&quot;\n\nSo now you're all walking north through forests. You're thinking about why Kota picked those two guys to join the rebellion and why he trusts them, especially March who he doesn't know. You wonder what Kota is doing right now, now that the rest of the group has suddenly disappeared. He should be coming back into town any day now. Whichever person you like or something asks you what you're thinking about (if it's Chess, he'll just look at you interestedly) and you'll say it's nothing, while looking at March and Madison dubiously.\n\nYou finally arrive at the new warehouse, which looks smaller than the other one. You collapse on the floor because your feet are in serious pain but Lonnie and Chess step outside of the new warehouse to discuss some things. You hear some grumbling from Madison and March about it. They don't like the fact that they're discussing things without the team since its supposed to be a team effort. You take it upon yourself to go and share this  little tidbit of information with them since the tension is starting to brew. Kota usually acted as the in between guy. You thought since you got along with both groups that you could play the part until he got back.\n\nAnyway as you are heading towards the door you walk past a window thats been boarded up but you can still hear what's going on outside. You hear Lonnie and Chess talking well more like arguing about something. It was strange because you'd never really heard them fight before. They were talking about Noemie. You remembered that Noemie was the girl in the picture, Sophie's daughter who was executed by the queen. You remembered Sophie telling you that the three of them had been close.\n\nBasically the argument is about Chess not being as trusting of the other guys and the amount of people getting involved (especially considering the run in they had the day before) while Lonnie was saying that they couldn't do it alone. Chess said not to forget what this was all for. Lonnie said that he was in love with her too. You're shocked. You knew they were friends but you didnt know they were in love. It's a love triangle!\n\nYou want to ask them about this, so you wait just next to the door. After a while you sit down. But they're taking a long time. You eventually fall asleep.\n\n[[Wake up to Chess]]\n[[Wake up to Lonnie]]\n\n</div><div tiddler="I'm a person!" tags="" created="201301040246" modifier="twee" twine-position="119,1063">Offended, you tell him you're a person, not an object, a who, not a what. &quot;Well, for a person, you aren't very smart.&quot; &lt;&lt;display &quot;Broken bridge dilemma&quot;&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Then let's go." tags="" created="201306130328" modifier="twee" twine-position="170,4287">&quot;Then let's go.

Not in this lifetime. There's a brief moment of silence. &quot;When you and March were talking, what was that Mad Madison thing about?&quot; you blurt out.\n\nMadison raises an eyebrow. &quot;A brief scientific escapade in my primary school days tripped a classroom alarm.&quot;\n\n&quot;Huh?&quot;\n\n&quot;It's a long, boring story,&quot; he says, waving his hand dismissively. You're sure it is.\n\n&quot;So you were a big fan of science?&quot;\n\n&quot;I still am,&quot; he corrects. &quot;In my spare time, I still like to read chemistry books... I rather regret not bringing any with me now, of course.&quot;\n\n&quot;Whoa.&quot; Yup, total opposites.

He says that he had heard that they were the ones to see about a rebellion. He had to ask around quite a bit but eventually someone talked and said where he could find them. &quot;But why them?&quot; you ask. He said he doesn't. Everyone has a reason to hate the Queen. Theirs must just be a little more personal. You prod him for more information and he seems unsure. Then he tells you that they're wanted. Surprisingly they're fairly high up on the Queen's priority list. You ask him hurriedly what they're wanted for. You sound a little more worried than you mean to. He defensively puts his hands up and says he has no idea but don't worry, half the people in Wonderland are wanted for something or other. \n\nYou think about what was said earlier. Something about a place called Eba. &quot;Eba is a place, right?&quot; He gives you a blank look before smiling. You get the feeling that this is a smile of resignation. He explains that Eba is a self-governed territory occupied by the Chiquay and Hautain tribes. He says that it neighbors Wonderland and you tell him to hold up. &quot;Wonderland?&quot; You don't want to offend him but this is silly. So instead, you cautiously ask &quot;And this is Wonderland?&quot; Kota looks at you with disbelief and asks you how you managed to get to a country--an island--without knowing its name. Then he says, yes, this is Wonderland. \n\nYou want to be the one in disbelief. Because it is still totally silly that he's suggesting you're in a place called Wonderland. That's kids stuff. Fantasy stuff. But you know it matches up. Well, not totally, but it certainly would explain the old-timey backwardness. Or &quot;quaintness&quot;, more nicely put. \n\nKota sees you thinking a lot. You respond that you're sorry, you were thrown for a loop.  You say, &quot;So the Queen wants to take Eba's silibrium. What's silibrium?&quot; You know you're asking stupid questions at this point, but being hesitant and embarrassed is tiring. Slightly less surprised this time, Kota explains that silibrium is a fuel that's most abundant in Eba. Wonderlanders use it heavily but it's limited. The most obvious place to mine for it would be Eba if it weren't for the treaty with Wonderland. However, it looks like the Queen no longer cares. Wonderland has had the military power to crush Eba for quite a while so the treaty has been basically meaningless in recent times. And now that she has a reason to do so, the Queen could very well put an end to Eba. That's why he has to fight and he needs someone to fight alongside him. But it looks like the rebellion was just a joke. He says this with a sad sort of smile.\n\n[[Make a rebellion]]</div><div tiddler="Vacuuming" tags="" created="201306180131" modifier="twee" twine-position="1066,304">The next day, you still haven't gotten used to the weird upside down vacuum thing but are trying to use it anyway.

You are about to go get a mop when Lonnie questions what you're doing and tells you to just vacuum it. Hesitantly, you do and it works. You look at the vacuum questioningly. You finish vacuuming this room and then a few more and then you and Lonnie go into another room. There's some beach stuff on the bed and a pile of sand on the floor. You begin to vacuum the sand--and the vacuum starts to make a sharp, loud skittering sound inside. You drop it and it breaks. Lonnie yells at you and asks you why you tried to vacuum sand. You argue back that it vacuumed water just now perfectly fine, so why can't it just vacuum sand? Lonnie shakes his head to clear his mind a little. Then he says that you're going to have to tell Sophie.\n\nYou go downstairs and Lonnie tells on you before you can think of a nicer way to phrase it. Sophie isn't surprised but slightly irritated. She tells you you're going to have to go buy a new one and starts drawing a map--you stop her quickly and tell her you can't read maps that good. She sighs and asks Chess, who isn't doing much of anything, to show you the store. Lonnie says he wants to come along, since he needs to buy something, too. So you all are walking to the store in an awkward silence when you see a guy casually bump into a lady on the other side of the street and both of them fall to the ground. The guy looks like he's apologizing and the woman says it's okay and keeps going. You notice that Chess and Lonnie are already crossing the street to catch up with the guy. Lonnie taps the guy on the shoulder and politely asks for the lady's belongings back and the woman checks her pockets and realizes her purse is gone. The guy shrugs him off roughly and Chess says that this could've been over now, but he sees that the guy wants to drag it out.\n\nAnother, bigger dude emerges from the shadows of an alley and says that Chess needs to back off and goes to shove him, but Chess dodges and Lonnie punches the dude in the back of the head. The lady shrieks. The smaller guy takes this distraction as an opportunity to grab Lonnie in a headlock but Chess pulls the guy by the hair and away from Lonnie and gives him a good elbow in the side. You just watch in awe as Chess and Lonnie manage to get the upperhand up on the two guys. Chess painfully prods the guy who took the wallet and suggests that he give it back to the lady and give her an apology. The man grudgingly does so and when he's done Lonnie gives him a hard pat on the back and whispers something that you're sure is incredibly frightening by the way the man pales. When the guys are released they quickly run off. \n\nLonnie and Chess come back to your side of the street and apologize for making you wait. You think about how incredibly cool they were just now. They fought really well, and worked together with good coordination. You wonder why they're so skilled at fighting with each other. You tell them how cool they were and make them link arms with you on the way to the store. Chess quickly pulls away but you just beam at him.\n\n[[A game of cards]]</div><div tiddler="Following Kota" tags="" created="201306130421" modifier="twee" twine-position="309,4434">Elai says he knows the path Kota always comes by because he always welcomes him there whenever he comes. If they go fast, they'll probably be able to catch him before he leaves. So you, Anang, and Elai run until Elai tells you to slow down and hide. You hide in the bushes and see Kota having a conversation with a middle aged man. They're talking about something pedestrian. You notice there's a vehicle maybe 10 yards behind Kota--the only vehicle you've seen. You're guessing it's his. Elai signals that now's your chance so you covertly run to the vehicle and try to duck into it... only to discover the doors are locked. Elai's shaking his head desperately and gesturing wildly at the trunk. The man is telling Kota to not be a stranger and come home again soon, and Kota says he will as soon as he gets the chance. Not much time left. The trunk, you whisper dubiously. Elai nods quickly and pushes you towards it. Elai gets in, you reluctantly follow, pushing Elai against the inside of the trunk further, and Anang jumps in last. How are you gonna close the trunk from the inside? Kota is already saying bye, you're lucky he's taking so long. At last, you see a hook on the inside of the trunk and you pull it closed quietly but quickly. You hear Kota's footsteps passing by and the driver's door opening and then closing as he sits down. Then motion. Success!\n\nYou guys have been riding in the trunk for what seems like forever. You've been talking to each other through whispers. There is a massive bump in the road that jostles all three of you badly. You're starting to wonder how much longer you can take of this, when the car stops. Elai says you're probably at Kota's house. You guys stop talking. Kota gets out of the vehicle and closes its door. After a tense silence, Anang asks, &quot;So do we get out?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, I think we should wait a little more,&quot; Elai murmurs thoughtfully. &quot;Let's wait a little more, until we're sure he's inside the house.&quot;\n\n&quot;What? No, we have to ambush him when he's most vulnerable! He'll never expect us to leap out now!&quot; Anang whispers furiously.\n\nYou agree with Elai quietly but Anang voices her disagreement again, in a loud whisper. To satisfy her, you tell her that he'll be just as surprised if he sees you guys knocking at his door so let's just wait for five minutes, shall we?\n\nAnang thinks it over and then agrees to it. She starts counting in a whisper. She gets to three minutes when suddenly the trunk pops open.\n\nKota is looking down at you all with a face like disbelief. Anang falls out of the trunk. &quot;What the actual hell are you doing in my trunk? I was just looking at my garden and heard all this noise coming from my car... I thought the Queen's people...&quot; He sighs before ordering you and Elai to get out of the trunk and you both do so.\n\nElai stands up straight and says he, you, and Anang want to join the rebellion--\n\nKota cuts him off saying absolutely not and that he might as well get back in the trunk because he's going straight back home.\n\nKota yawns and his stomach growls. &quot;That is, first thing tomorrow afternoon.&quot;\n\n&quot;Afternoon?&quot; you repeat.\n\nIt turns out Kota has a work meeting tomorrow morning. So you better stay in the house and not make any more trouble for him. He opens the front door and lets you into the dark house. You see a couch set. He orders you to sit. You all do. He says he hopes you like the sofa because that's where you're going to sleep tonight and fat chance if you think you're getting any food. He walks into his room and slams the door.\n\nYou guys look at each other. Elai guesses Kota's mad. Then he says you'd better get comfy. He awkwardly lies on his side, using his hands for a pillow. You and Anang do the same. You all close your eyes though you don't think sleep will ever come like this.\n\nAfter half an hour, Kota shamefully stumbles back into the living room. You didn't fall asleep. Through barely open eyes you can see him surveying you guys. With more shame, he wakes up the obviously uncomfortable Elai and then you and Anang. He apologizes for being so hard on you guys and tells you guys you can sleep on his guest bed. He'll make you some snacks and you can have showers in the meantime. He apologizes again and says he feels really bad. He ruffles Elai's hair and says how could he give his little bro such a terrible welcome on his first visit to his house? He tells you all to make yourselves comfortable.\n\nElai goes to shower first. You sit at Kota's kitchen table and Kota also sits. He notices a sticky note on the table with confusion, as if he hadn't been the one to place it there. Picking it up, he reads it and looks alarmed immediately after, but tries to mask the expression with a neutral one. He pockets the sticky note. You guys awkwardly sit there for a few minutes. Kota says, &quot;So you're Elai's friend, right?&quot; You nod. He says that's a shame, because at his age he definitely should've had a girlfriend or two. &quot;So... where'd you say you were from again?&quot; You hear a door open. Elai comes out of the bathroom in some of Kota's clothes. It wasn't even that long ago that he went in. Elai explains that he showers quickly and tells you the bath's free, so you go.\n\nThe next day, Kota tells you guys he's leaving but it's going to be a few hours longer than usual. Still, he will be back in the late afternoon for them, so don't get into trouble and he'll be back in a few hours. You see him in the garden looking at a pretty flower fondly,talking to it, and reaching for a watering jug, so Elai stands up and says he found a back door last night. He leads you guys out through it and you walk around the other side of the house, out of Kota's view. You sneak past his back and back into the trunk in the same order as before, wordlessly. After a while, Kota drives off.\n\nIt's incredibly uncomfortable and cramped but at least it's not a hot day. &quot;How much longer?&quot; you whisper.\n\nElai responds grumpily, &quot;How would I know?&quot; He's probably grumpy because he's laying in the opposite side, with both of your feet by his face.\n\nSomehow, you manage to fall asleep. Barely. You wake when you feel the motion stop. You hear Kota get out of his car and hope he won't open the trunk again. Then again, it's not like you can just live in here. You're going to have to face him eventually.\n\nYou all wait a while, before getting out and stretching. Crouching, you notice that he parked in front of a warehouse. In fact, all you can see is warehouses around you. You notice Anang has already moved up to the window to peek in.\n\n&quot;You know we're gonna have to go in, right?&quot; Elai asks quietly but incredulously.\n\n&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Anang whispers back.\n\n&quot;I guess it's do or die now,&quot; you sigh.\n\n&quot;Right!&quot; Anang says, and slams the door open.\n\nElai stands up and collects himself quickly. &quot;I am Elai of the Tribe of Chiquay...&quot;\n\n&quot;and I am Warrior Anang of the proud Hautain people of Eba...&quot; Elai shoots her a quick distressed look but the look is quickly gone.\n\n&quot;And we are here to join the rebellion!&quot; They say together finally.\n\n&quot;And me too,&quot; you add lamely. \n\nAn adult with glasses asks for an explanation and Kota says with frustration that it's his little brother and a girl from the neighboring tribe and they stowed away in his car. Again. Kota says he has no idea why they keep doing it and they say they said they want to join the rebellion. A man with short black hair looks at him accusingly and Kota responds not to worry, they're going back home right now. An orange haired boy says that's the thing. They can't. You see, when he went to Kota's house, he just wanted to talk to him but he noticed that Kota's house was under surveillance. So it would probably be best for all of them to lay low for now, because they could be in danger. Madison nods to that and the black haired man grunts. Now what's weird, Orange says, is that they didn't keep watching him once he left the house. He thinks there may be a traitor among them. Chess says that it's possible that it's just some sort of trap and that that's a lot to assume. A blonde boy agrees agrees and the glasses man says nothing but folds his arms. Chess says that there's no point in deliberating about this if they're not even certain it's true.\nSo, for Kota, the black haired man repeats the plan. They are going to replace the silibrium supply of the Queen's area of the castle with fake silibrium. This will leave the area without power, allowing them to get close to the Queen. Kota asks how they're going to make fake silibrium but Chess says it's already been done. It's located in another warehouse. Orange grins sheepishly and apologizes to everyone for not mentioning it. Elai asks how they're going to get the silibrium inside the castle and everyone gives him a dubious and/or dirty look. Black Hair responds that the person who is delivering the fake silibrium to the castle is the person who used to deliver food to the inn. Anang asks how they're going to get them to use the fake silibrium instead of theirs. Black Hair says that the maintenance person at the castle doesn't like the Queen and that he already convinced him to join their side. Any more questions? You shake your head. &quot;Then we should be good to go,&quot; he said finally. &quot;We need to meet with our contact in the castle tonight and make sure the plan's set in stone.\n\n&quot;Um, wait!&quot; you blurt out.\n\nEveryone looks at you.\n\n&quot;Shouldn't we get introduced?&quot;\n\nThe glasses man pinches the bridge of his nose, barely containing his irritation. &quot;I'm Madison, the Queen's chef, but I'm on your side now.&quot; Gesturing to Orange he says, &quot;This is March. He's skilled at disguise and subterfuge.&quot; March scratches the back of his neck and grins, saying &quot;Aw, shucks.&quot; Gesturing to Black Hair, he says &quot;This is Chess&quot; and to the blonde,&quot; and this is Lonnie. They're former soldiers, current alcoholics.&quot;\n\nLonnie pipes up, &quot;That is so untrue! We drink like... once a week at best!&quot;\n\n&quot;Nice to meet all of you,&quot; you say, shaking hands with all of them. Elai and Anang look a bit bewildered by what you're doing, but you can't bother to explain.\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; Lonnie says, &quot;if that's really it, we'd best be on our way.&quot;\n\n&quot;Is it safe?&quot; you can't help but ask.\n\n&quot;Safe enough,&quot; he responds. \n\n[[Chess and Lonnie's departure]]</div><div tiddler="Ask about silibrium" tags="" created="201307010235" modifier="twee" twine-position="1004,1584">You say that this might sound stupid but... what's silibrium? Kota repeats silibrium, like he's not sure you actually are asking. You nod. He explains that silibrium is a fuel source most abundant in Eba. Wonderlanders use it heavily but it's limited. The most obvious place to mine for it would be Eba if it weren't for the treaty with Wonderland. However, it looks like the Queen no longer cares. Wonderland has had the military power to crush Eba for quite a while so the treaty has been basically meaningless in recent times. And now that she has a reason to do so, the Queen could very well put an end to Eba. \n\nYou think he wants a sympathetic or understanding or grave look in response. Unfortunately, all you can do is show a very confused face. &quot;Is Eba a place, then?&quot; He gives you a blank look. \n\nHe smiles. You get the feeling that this is a smile of resignation. He explains that Eba is a self-governed territory occupied by the Chiquay and Hautain tribes. He says that it neighbors Wonderland and you tell him to hold up. &quot;Wonderland?&quot; You don't want to offend him but this is silly. So instead, you cautiously ask &quot;And this is Wonderland?&quot; Kota looks at you with disbelief and asks you how you managed to get to a country--an island--without knowing its name. Then he says, yes, this is Wonderland. \n\nYou want to be the one in disbelief. Because it is still totally silly that he's suggesting you're in a place called Wonderland. That's kids stuff. Fantasy stuff. But you know it matches up. Well, not totally, but it certainly would explain the old-timey backwardness. Or &quot;quaintness&quot;, more nicely put. \n\n&quot;So you said there's a rebellion? And Chess and Lonnie are a part of it?&quot; Kota says yes. Or at least that's what he thought until a few minutes ago.  But it looks like the rebellion was just a joke. He says this with a sad sort of smile. He was hoping there'd be someone he could fight with, so that he could save his family and his home. Even if he got his younger brother out of Eba, there'd still be everyone else to worry about.\n\n[[Make a rebellion]]</div><div tiddler="More arguments outside v2" tags="" created="201706280422" modifier="twee" twine-position="2094,5042">You walk away, having talked to everyone, and take a seat in the corner of the warehouse you'd claimed as your own. You take out the riddle and study it closely trying for what might have been the millionth time to make sense of it. Eventually you fall into a light sleep. You wake up to the sounds of argument behind your head and to the right. It's coming from outside. Everyone must be having the brilliant idea of having it out outside so the rest of the group doesn't have to see their division, you realize. The voices sound like March's and Madison's.\n\n[[Scoot closer to the sound v2]]\n[[Stay put v2]]</div><div tiddler="Go to sleep" tags="" created="201311100011" modifier="twee" twine-position="1141,5496">Well.

You ask her to tell you then, because you have no idea what to say about it. She tells you the Chief called her and reprimanded her and said that she mustn't forget her duty as a warrior. Anang knows that there wasn't anything wrong with trying to unite the two tribes but she also knows that keeping this up will endanger her position as a warrior. \n\n[[Yeah, I understand.]]\n[[How could you?]]</div><div tiddler="Talk to Madison" tags="" created="201311090010" modifier="twee" twine-position="768,4897">You sit down cross legged in front of Madison, mirroring his pose. He looks at the book for a moment longer before closing it.\n\n&quot;How are you doing... Alice?&quot; he ventures.\n\nYou shake your head and say it's Allison and then say you're fine. Struggling to find something to talk about, you ask what he was reading. With some reluctance, he tells you he was reading a fantasy book. You express your disbelief and surprise and he says with a slight smile that there is some appeal to the idea of forgetting about the real world and the problems of real life, isn't there? You say you guess.\n\nYou're sure that your response seems curt and you don't want to come off as rude. So you awkwardly continue on.\n\n&quot;You don't seem like you would have many problems. You seem very...put together, like you have your head on straight.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, do I?&quot; He seems mildly amused. &quot;I suppose I attempt to put on a good face. Always have. But I too have my own concerns. I see you over in your corner sometimes with the most perplexing look on your face. Looking at some kind of paper. It appears that you have your own problems as well.&quot;\n\nYou blush, you hadn't known anyone had seen you. &quot;It's just...a riddle I've been given...I'm having a little-er-- trouble..&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, a riddle. March is very good at those. I have also solved a riddle or two in my time. If you're ever ready to throw in the towel I'll happily assist you.&quot;\n\nYou tell him that you may take him up on the offer. He smiles before going back to his book.\n\n[[More arguments outside]]</div><div tiddler="Asking Chess" tags="" created="201306222337" modifier="twee" twine-position="1059,945">You go to Chess and ask him about the jello lake and whether that's actually true. He asks you what do you think? You say of course it isn't--for starters, where would someone even get all that jello? He says that he can verify that it is 100% existent. You ask if he's seen it himself, and he says yes. You ask him to show you to the jello lake and he says flatly no, he's busy with more important things. You ask for him to at least write you directions and he sighs and acquiesces. You thank him a little brusquely, briefly look at the directions, and head out the door... only to be pulled to a screeching halt by Chess grabbing you by the upper arm. He informs you with a deadpannish look that you're going the wrong way and you complain for him to at least let you out the door first. He physically holds your shoulders and turns you the right way before pointing down the road and telling you where to make a turn. You continue down the road before turning and Chess immediately yells that that's the wrong way before catching up and pointing you to where you should be going. You ask him to just show you to where you need to go and he says no, he's busy. You shrug and say whatever before continuing, briefly glancing at the map and then the street turns... and you make another turn where you're supposed to go straight, so Chess drags you a few feet over to the right street by your wrist before watching you with his arms crossed. You look at him annoyed before looking at the map carefully and walking in the appropriate direction. Which turns out to be the wrong place once again. Chess is yelling at you about if it can seriously be that hard to read directions and you're saying, defensively, that when you see directions your eyes tend to sorta glaze over, okay? Chess is telling you he has no time to babysit someone who won't even bother to accept the help that's been handed to her so you can find the way to the lake on your own from here--\n\n&quot;Is that the jello lake?!&quot; you yell excitedly before dragging a flabbergasted Chess who was standing totally still towards the lake. The sun's pretty much done setting.\n\nChess shakes his head in disbelief and shame. &quot;After all that, I actually personally walked you to the lake.&quot;\n\nYou ignore his obvious unwillingness and drag him to the pier. You stare down at the lake and declare that it can't really be jello. It must be an optical illusion of some sort. He said if you tasted it, you'd know for sure. You like this idea so much that you lie prone on the pier and lean off the edge of it to try to reach the water. But it's defintely too far. Chess, a little panicked, runs over to you and pulls you to your feet securely. He tells you not to do that. You ask why. He tells you that the jello isn't enough to support you and you could definitely still drown. &quot;Then hold me over the edge so I can reach the water.&quot; &quot;Absolutely not.&quot; &quot;Fine then, I know how to swim--&quot; &quot;Don't!&quot; he says, freaking out just a little. He says fine, he'll hold you over, but don't move too much.\n\nSo he's holding you over the jello water and you're about to reach down to get a scoop when a flashlight flashes on the two of you. &quot;Over there! Identify yourselves. Why are you out at this time?&quot; says a somewhat young but authoritative voice. You look and see see two people in identical silly getups (upside down, because you're upside down). You ask Chess at an unsuitably loud volume who the guys in the dumb clothes think they are. Chess, pulling you up and looking a little worried, says that the man is a soldier. He stands totally still, like he's paused, still holding your hands, as if this will cause the soldier to go away. Instead, the soldier calls out to you asking what are you standing there for and asking for you to come over. You gently suggest that maybe it'd be best if you two just complied, and give his hand a reassuring squeeze, which reminds him that he's still holding your hands and causes him to push your hands away immediately. He starts walking towards the soldiers, but doesn't come too close. He looks down and away from them. They notice. They again ask for him to state his name and reason for being out. Chess is not at all forthcoming about an answer, so you speak up.\n\n[[We're here to see the jello lake.]]\n[[We're out for a stroll.]]\n[[Argue with the soldiers]]</div><div tiddler="Madison's path Start" tags="" created="201706280640" modifier="twee" twine-position="4864,7030"></div><div tiddler="I should go look for March v2" tags="" created="201706280429" modifier="twee" twine-position="1875,5661">&quot;... maybe I should go look for March,&quot; you finish.\n\nMadison stiffens. &quot;Absolutely not. March is skilled at evasion and subterfuge. You, on the other hand, are not. Please, Allison. He'll be back by morning.&quot;\n\n&quot;But I don't think he should be alone... come on.&quot;\n\nHe shakes his head. &quot;I suppose I can't stop you. Just don't look too hard. As I said, he can be hard to find when he wants to be.&quot;\n\nYou put on your shoes and leave the warehouse. You start walking around its proximity but you're unsure of where March might be. All these warehouses look the same, so you're starting to get confused about where you are. The one you were in had a number on it, didn't it? You probably should've memorized it.\n\nYou sit down on the ground to think. Better to do that than to walk around and get even more lost. You admire the night sky so different from the one at home. Starry. As you look around, you see March on a rooftop so you make your way towards him. He spots you.\n\n&quot;Hey, are you doing okay?&quot; you try.\n\n&quot;I'm fine, but I kind of feel like being alone right now.&quot;\n\n&quot;Except for the company of a beautiful woman?&quot;\n\n&quot;Ha. I suppose you're right.&quot; He makes his way down slowly.\n\n&quot;What happened with you guys?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nothing much. Madison can get a bit... untrusting at times, I guess. Then again, it's not his fault. His father has always pit us against each other.&quot; He pauses. &quot;It's funny, actually... because even when Madison wins, he still loses in the end. Even though he wants to be loved by him so badly, it's painful to watch... nothing is ever enough for his dad. And yet he's all about me, the one who's not even his kid. If I ever end up running Lapis, the first chance I get, I'm putting Madison in charge.&quot;\n\nFor a while, neither of you say a thing. Then you speak up. &quot;You know, he said you can be hard to find when you want to be. But I didn't have all that much trouble. So I guess you wanted to be found?&quot;\n\nHe turns away but you can tell by his ears he's blushing.\n\n\tMarch's path:\n\t&quot;By you, maybe,&quot; he mumbles.\n\n\tOther:\n\t&quot;I guess I'm still a dumb kid deep down,&quot; he says with a laugh.\n\n&quot;Do you wanna go back?&quot;\n\nHe stretches. &quot;I guess I should.&quot;\n\nWhen you go back, you're shiverring a bit so March snuggles up with you.\n\n[[A midsummer night's dream]]</div><div tiddler="Madison: Tax problems" tags="" created="201601180426" modifier="twee" twine-position="1758,3287">One day, after work, Madison's dad comes by one night and he greets you curtly as Madison lets him in. He says that he needs to speak to both Madison and March. They go into Madison's office and Madison asks that you bring by something for his dad to eat. When you come with some tea and biscuits, you hear Madison's dad informing them that Lapis is doing really well lately, so the Queen has decided that it needs to be taxed more as a result. However, the tax she leverages on it is more than 100% of the company's yearly income. Madison's dad goes on about how Madison has always been a bit of a let down to him but March is like a son to him and he knows he'll make a great president to Lapis one day. You drop a spoon you're holding in surprise. There's a silence. Did anyone hear you...? \n\nMadison suddenly says, &quot;I'll get you some more of that tea,&quot; and before you realize what's happening, he opens the door. He isn't the slightest bit surprised at your presence. &quot;Glad to see our conversation's keeping you on the metaphorical edge of your seat,&quot; he says to you, voice laden with irony. In the room, Madison's dad says that actually, he should be on his way now and thanks for the tea and biscuits. Madison's dad leaves without noticing you, and March follows him out, seeing you and Madison. March's eyes widen and he jokes that it looks like their Allison will make a great spy one day. Madison asks in a flat tone what were you eavesdropping on now. You admit that you heard that Lapis is going to be taxed out of existence. Madison says yes, he's surprised the Queen would do that to a company she ought to love. You ask what he means by that. He explains that the Queen really likes the comics that come on the back of Lapis cookies. You ask what about the cookies themselves? He says the Queen does like her sweets.\n\nYou pace back and forth thinking and then you blurt out, &quot;Iron Chef!&quot; Madison and March stare in blank bewilderment, so you explain. You could have a competition with all the best pastry chefs in Wonderland where they have a limited selection of ingredients to use to make a dish for the Queen. Since she likes sweets, maybe it could be dessert. She'd be the judge of the competition and the winner gets... you haven't thought that far yet. But it's a good idea, right? March is excited. Madison says he isn't sure it will work. March looks at him with meaning and says that if not, he has something else in mind. You and March are both hyped and get to planning.\n\n[[Meeting at the bar]]</div><div tiddler="Argue with the soldiers" tags="" created="201306230304" modifier="twee" twine-position="1238,1125">&quot;Well, who are /you/ and what are /you/ doing out here this late?&quot; you retort.\n\nThe soldier is taken aback by how stupid of a question that is, but the second soldier, who was quiet up till now, gives you the benefit of the doubt. He explains that they're soldiers and they're just making sure everyone's safe and sound and watching out for suspicious activity. The first soldier tells the second, annoyed, that you know that and you're just trying to buy time. Ulp.\n\n[[Getting away with Chess]]</div><div tiddler="A few days later" tags="" created="201601060316" modifier="twee" twine-position="1802,2624">You wake up to a terrible stabbing internal pain. Early morning light shines through the window. Are you being murdered? Of course not. It's just that time of month. A tear drips down your face and it's too painful to move. So you lay there still. You have no medications here. You don't know whether you should wake up the others by calling for help (what could they do?) or wait for the pain to pass.\n\n[[Call for help]]\n[[Wait for the pain to pass]]</div><div tiddler="Stay put" tags="" created="201311092332" modifier="twee" twine-position="1158,5296">You don't dare move. You stay in one place as the conversation grows more and more audible. Finally, you can make out some words. Madison's shouting.\n\n&quot;This is what you wanted all along!&quot;\n\n&quot;I cannot believe you. I've been your friend when you've had no one else. To believe I could be that conniving...Do we even know each other at all?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don't know, do we?&quot;\n\nYou hear the sound of someone stomping away.\n\n[[Go outside]]\n[[Go to sleep]]</div><div tiddler="Ask about Eba" tags="" created="201307010234" modifier="twee" twine-position="859,1582">&quot;So Eba is your home?&quot;\n\nHe nods and explains that, while he hasn't had the chance to visit as often as he wants to lately, it's still his home and it's where his family lives. Even if he managed to get his younger brother out of Eba, there's still everyone else to worry about. He wouldn't even wish a fate like this on the Hautain.\n\nYou think he wants a sympathetic or understanding or grave look in response. Unfortunately, all you can do is show a very confused face. &quot;Is Eba a place, then?&quot; He gives you a blank look. &quot;It's a like a building, right...? An apartment complex...? A community? A city?&quot;\n\nHe smiles. You get the feeling that this is a smile of resignation. He explains that Eba is a self-governed territory occupied by the Chiquay and Hautain tribes. He says that it neighbors Wonderland and you tell him to hold up. &quot;Wonderland?&quot; You don't want to offend him but this is silly. So instead, you cautiously ask &quot;And this is Wonderland?&quot; Kota looks at you with disbelief and asks you how you managed to get to a country--an island--without knowing its name. Then he says, yes, this is Wonderland. \n\nYou want to be the one in disbelief. Because it is still totally silly that he's suggesting you're in a place called Wonderland. That's kids stuff. Fantasy stuff. But you know it matches up. Well, not totally, but it certainly would explain the old-timey backwardness. Or &quot;quaintness&quot;, more nicely put. \n\nKota sees you thinking a lot. You respond that you're sorry, you were thrown for a loop.  You say, &quot;So the Queen wants to take Eba's silibrium. What's silibrium?&quot; You know you're asking stupid questions at this point, but being hesitant and embarrassed is tiring. Slightly less surprised this time, Kota explains that silibrium is a fuel that's most abundant in Eba. Wonderlanders use it heavily but it's limited. The most obvious place to mine for it would be Eba if it weren't for the treaty with Wonderland. However, it looks like the Queen no longer cares. Wonderland has had the military power to crush Eba for quite a while so the treaty has been basically meaningless in recent times. And now that she has a reason to do so, the Queen could very well put an end to Eba. That's why he has to fight and he needs someone to fight alongside him. &quot;Then... Chess and Lonnie are part of this rebellion?&quot; He said that's what he thought. But it looks like the rebellion was just a joke. He says this with a sad sort of smile.\n\n[[Make a rebellion]]</div><div tiddler="Go left" tags="" created="201301040420" modifier="twee" twine-position="1070,-6">You attempt to go around. You travel for a day before reaching lights. Seeing the lights encourages you and you find the strength to find an inn in which you can collapse, after introducing yourself and promising the innkeeper, a rough but friendly woman named Sophie, you will work for your board as a maid.\n\nThe next day, Sophie tells you what your duties are. So you do the duties but when you go to bed you think about how you're going to get home. The day after that, Sophie introduces you to a tall surly-looking guy with black hair named Chess and a not nearly as tall cute blonde boy named Lonnie, who help out around there. She says that they'll be showing you the ropes... right? Lonnie says yes but Chess completely ignores that she even said anything. So you ignore Chess and shake Lonnie's hand enthusiastically.\n\nLonnie tells you that for now, you're responsible for the east half of the second floor. He gives you an otherworldly looking contraption and tells you to get to it. You stare at it blankly and ask what you're supposed to do with it. He looks at you incredulously and says that it's a vacuum and you vacuum with it. You're taken aback. He asks haven't you ever seen a vacuum before? Offended, you don't respond to that but say that it must be some new kind because you've never used one like this before. You hold the vacuum oddly on the ground, unsure of how to use it.\n\nLonnie gently takes it from you and turns it upside down before flipping a switch you hadn't seen before. Nothing happens, and he remarks that it looks like it's out of silibrium. So he opens up a drawer, takes this metallic looking liquid in a container out, and pours it into the vacuum. It starts to run. You look at him, utterly confused. Lonnie vacuums a little, demonstrating, and runs over your foot on accident, which freaks you out a little. Lonnie apologizes and asks if he needs to explain how to use the broom, too? He takes out a totally normal looking broom. You say you're quite fine and take the broom from him and start sweeping, looking at the vacuum distrustfully.\n\nA few days later, Sophie takes you to her apartment in the inn, and smokes hookah, and offers you some and you're like &quot;Uh, no thanks.&quot; She's like suit yourself. She asks you where you're from and you say you're from Coral Beach. She asks Coral Beach where and you say, confused, Coral Beach, Florida. Sophie squints at you. You say hasn't she ever heard of Florida? She tells you flatly no. You are weirded out so you kinda stay away from the topic. You look around the room and see a photo of a pretty girl. You ask who that is. She says it's her daughter. You ask why you haven't seen her around. She says she died. Sophie looks a little uncomfortable but you're really curious. Should you ask, even if it might upset her?\n\n[[Find out more]]\n[[Drop the topic]]</div><div tiddler="The traitor is March" tags="" created="201401200213" modifier="twee" twine-position="1206,6174">March's path: &quot;Seriously? You've gotta be kidding me... Allison, we're the ones who brought you here in the first place! Did you not trust us all this time?&quot; he yells, hurt. Then, more quietly... &quot;Did you not trust me?&quot;\n\nYou can't say anything. You did just accuse him.&quot;\n\nMore solemn than you've ever seen him, voice devoid of all lightness, he asks, &quot;So why me?&quot;\n\nOther: \n\t&quot;Oh, this is gonna be good,&quot; March says, no longer his usual lighthearted self. &quot;And why? Why am I the traitor?&quot;\n\n[[Freedom of movement]]\n[[The flammable silibrium (March)]]</div><div tiddler="I'll work with March" tags="" created="201406090501" modifier="twee" twine-position="2117,1865">You announce that you'll work with March and March jumps up and down and clasps your hands. He says it's going to be fun.\n\nAt work, you find out March is a cashier and a stocker. He wears an apron and looks very cute in it.\n\nYou must wear an overly fancy and garish dress that looks like something from a renaissance fair. Your job is to hand out samples but very few people come by. There was an old lady who hobbled by with a cane, a businessman on break, and a few others. Then you hear a large bell in the distance. March remarks that classes are over at St. Ecria's Girls' School. You think nothing of it, until 15 minutes later, when they start pouring in. At first it's just one or two girls who pass right by you, ignoring samples in favor of making rather direct and flirtatious eye contact with March and doing business with him. Then it's a swarm. You try to offer some of them samples but are met with disinterest and occasionally disgust. You feel a way.\n\nJust as you're feeling a little dejected you see Camille off to side looking suspicious, like she's trying to avoid being seen. You go over to her, kind of surprising her. You offer her a free sample. It happens to be of the cookies she was raving so much about before. She turns an awful shade of green for point two seconds but then politely declines, saying no thanks, she could buy as many of these as she wanted. You look at her askance but say nothing. March sees her hiding in the corner and with an amused look calls out to her. She looks a little shocked at first but waves to him with embarrassment. He waves her over and asks if she would like to try some free samples. The greenness has returned to her face but she happily makes her way over, although not without a wary glance towards the crowd of girls now starting to look at her with suspicion. March calls you over, too.\n\nHe remarks that you look a little hot in that costume and asks if you want him to take it off for you. You swiftly decline and he laughs. The girls' attention all turns to you. He offers you a free sample. Go on, take it. You say you're okay, but he insists. You say you're really okay, and he shoves a cookie in your mouth unromantically. You complain through the cookie that you're not trying to gain weight but he doesn't listen. Everyone's eyes have already flashed red with hatred. In a few seconds, you've made about fifteen enemies.\n[[Cooking]]</div><div tiddler="Go to the Chief now" tags="" created="201301110131" modifier="twee" twine-position="435,2147">A little worried but trying to hide it, Anang takes you to see the chief.\n\n[[Confrontation with the Chief]]</div><div tiddler="Make your desk lamp levitate" tags="" created="201601060310" modifier="twee" twine-position="1811,2341">You try to make your desk lamp levitate with your mind.

Eventually it subsides enough for you to get up and go knock on Madison's door. You apologize for waking him up and tell him you've got some terrible cramps. He leaves his room and comes back with milk in a mug for you. You raise your eyebrow. He gestures for you to drink it, so you do. &quot;You should feel better soon. Do you think you'll be able to work?&quot;\n\nYou shake your head. &quot;Very well, I'll let them know you can't make it. Get some rest.&quot; You return to your room.\n\nWhen you wake up in the late afternoon, you feel much better. Not perfect, there's some residual pain. But better. You look around the house. Madison went to work. You make yourself something to eat and go back to sleep, because you have nothing else to do.\n\n[[Another work day]]</div><div tiddler="Who to work with" tags="" created="201406090458" modifier="twee" twine-position="1957,1687">When everyone gets home, they look at you expectantly.

It feels strange to be invited however if you don't come you'll kind of be lurking around upstairs for the evening and that alternative doesn't seem appealing. The clothes you were provided were okay for lounging around the house but the definitely not appropriate for dinner with the parents. Madison brandishes a dress for you to wear. You bashfully accept though you feel strangely like a doll being given clothes and invited to a fancy dinner. So you nervously prepare for the dinner.\n\nAt the dinner you are introduced to a man and a woman who bare a striking resemblance to Madison Spelling. They are his parents. You note that they do not look anything like March however there is an obvious preference towards him. They greet March warmly but the greeting towards Madison is short and curt. From the conversation you gather that March works closely with Mr. Spelling at his company Lapis. You also learn that March and Madison are childhood friends. You feel embarrassed that you had assumed they were romantically involved. The conversation turns to you. They begin asking you questions about who you are and where you came from. Between March, Madison, and you you have established that perhaps you're not from this world or at least nor from anywhere they've heard of. And that information was hard enough to digest. You catch a subtle look from March and a similar one from Madison. You can't tell whether to be honest or to tell a white lie.\n\n[[Tell the truth]]\n[[Lie]]\n</div><div tiddler="Back to Madison's house" tags="" created="201406090229" modifier="twee" twine-position="1943,1339">When you go back to Madison's house, if you spent the day with March, Madison displays a polite interest in how your day went.

The next day, you go to work with the other person.\n\n[[Work with Madison the next day]]\n[[Work with March the next day]]</div><div tiddler="The traitor is me" tags="" created="201401200227" modifier="twee" twine-position="1697,6173">Everyone's head snaps up to look at you.\n\n&quot;Serious?&quot; Chess asks, incredulous.\n\n&quot;Come on, Allison. This isn't the time to joke,&quot; Lonnie says looking exasperated.\n\n&quot;We didn't need a mood-lightener, Allison,&quot; March says, shaking his head and sighing.\n\n&quot;Please. Allison, are you being honest or facetious?&quot; Madison asks, so serious you feel like a kid getting in trouble at school for a lame prank.\n\n&quot;... Facetious. Ahaha. Sorry, guys, I was just messing with ya. Ahahahahaha.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then you can save your 'humor' for later,&quot; Madison concludes\n\nKota looks at you with disappointment. \n\n[[Going nowhere fast]]</div><div tiddler="Wake up to Chess" tags="" created="201308242135" modifier="twee" twine-position="941,3594">You wake up, vaguely aware of someone picking you up. You hear Chess's voice, very close but quiet, saying that he has no idea why you wanted to sleep on the floor. Farther, you hear Lonnie sputtering about how he doesn't have to pick you up either. Your eyes flash open at that but you close them again really quick. Chess says simply that you'll wake up in pain if you sleep on the floor like that. Lonnie asks Chess suspiciously if he has a crush on you. You stiffen and try to hide the fact that you're awake. Chess considers for a moment. &quot;Yes. No, it's not just a crush. She is my moon and stars, my sky, my only reason for going on.&quot; Your face heats up. Sweat from nervousness is dampening your skin and you fight the urge to shift. &quot;Isn't that what you'd like to hear, Allison?&quot; Chess says to you. You jump.\n\nChess says if you're awake, you might as well walk the rest of the way. He slows down like he's about to let you down. But doesn't. You don't comment on it. He sets you down on a futon and leaves, saying that he and Lonnie should get to bed too.\n\n\n[[Marchless morning]]</div><div tiddler="Duck into the shadows" tags="" created="201605140248" modifier="twee" twine-position="1837,3960">You weren't even supposed to be there anyway. You duck into the shadow and pray that no one sees you. How could things have gone so horribly wrong? You'd just wanted to help save Lapis but instead... you'd ruined everything. Things were probably even worse. You watch as the contestants are dragged away. They'd been so apprehensive about this competition. How Madison had gotten them to agree you didn't know. But now they looked to him with helpless eyes. You could tell he was as shocked as you. You'd never seen that expression on his face before. But just as quick the look is covered with a mask of practiced control. It chills you to the bone.\n\nIt seems as though everyone in the room was sent to the dungeons to await execution. You wait for chance and manage to slip out the room unseen. You stumble into one of the employee rooms and break down in tears. What had just happened? The queen was worse than what people had said. How long could this go on for. You barely hear him slip in but you feel Madison wrap one arm around you. You turn and cry into his chest.\n\nYou don't speak and after a little while you guys go home, you are traumatized, Madison is guilty he couldn’t protect you from seeing it and guilty he let so many people die just because he wanted to save Lapis (and was scared to go ahead with the rebellion).\n\nHe leaves you in your room where you remain distraught.You hear him having a hushed but fervent exchange of words with March before they throw on jackets and leave the house in a hurry.\n\nThey don't come home that night.\n\n[[Ransacked]]</div><div tiddler="Outskirts of Eba" tags="" created="201401192314" modifier="twee" twine-position="1038,5999">It's time to head out to the designated meeting area. It's a secluded area on the outskirts of Eba. You are all able to make it there without being noticed. It seems like there isn't much travel to and fro Eba and Terovius. As planned, you all should be meeting with a man named Theo who is the informant in the castle. You've heard from Lonnie that he is one of the evil Queen's trusted seers. However once you arrive Theo is no where to be found. This sounds the first alarm.\n\nLonnie seems tense and you know immedietely that this wasn't a part of the plan.\n\n&quot;He should be here by now.&quot;\n\nChess's jaw clenched but he doesn't say a word as he stares with steely eyes in the direction of the castle. You can see the silhouette of the castle's highest peak even from Eba. March suggests that they wait a few more minutes but at that point it wasn't even a question.\n\nFinally, after what seems like hours you see a man riding some kind of futuristic looking bike/scooter thingy towards the group's direction. He looks tall and sturdy with broad shoulders and long legs. By the relieved looks on everyone's faces you surmise that this must be Theo. You nearly let out a sigh of relief but the look on Theo's face when he arrives and powers off the bike lets you know that the relief will be very short lived. His eyes have a slightly wild look to them, your eyes meet for the briefest second and you feel as though he'd seen through you.\n\nYou shiver and think of the seer that you met in town once before. He was a small dilapidated man with white hair and crazy eyes. You assumed he'd gone crazy from the visions. Perhaps all seers had a bit of madness to them. \n\nTheo wastes no time getting into it. He quickly explains what happened. They find out that the delivery was never made. There was an accident on the way to the castle and the delivery guy was severely injured but managed to escape before the truck caught on fire.\n\nAfter taking it all in everyone is silent. How could things have gone this wrong?\n\nIt's suspicious.\n\n&quot;What's going on...?&quot; Lonnie asks, finally breaking the silence.\n\n&quot;A vital part of our plan has gone amiss. How are we going to get close to the queen without the silibrium being changed out?&quot; Madison speaks out in disgust.\n\nYou glance over at Chess and Lonnie and see a variety of expressions play across their faces. Your heart goes out to them.\n\n&quot;How did this happen?&quot; Chess asks gravely. Everyone else looks expectantly at Theo for the answer.\n\n&quot;Phil says that someone left something on the road and that's how they crashed. Someone had to have left whatever it was there in the road on purpose leading to the accident.&quot;\n\n&quot;Wait a minute. Something on the road?&quot; you ask.\n\nTheo looks hesitant. &quot;Yes. A fallen tree.&quot;\n\n&quot;A tree?!&quot; Lonnie exclaims. &quot;And he couldn't just see it and drive around it?!&quot;\n\nChess gives Theo a hard look. &quot;I don't know why you're protecting Phil, but you're going to need to tell us the whole truth.&quot;\n\nTheo looks away. &quot;Well, Phil said that when he was driving... he started feeling a little tired.&quot;\n\n&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Kota says, voicing your thoughts. Elai and Anang look pensive.\n\n&quot;He swears he got a full night's sleep, but he started nodding off--he couldn't help it, man--and he couldn't react to the tree in time...&quot; Theo trailed off.\n\n&quot;We have to come up with another plan.&quot; Chess's voice is hard.\n\nThat's for sure. But the idea of starting from the beginning is daunting. \n\n&quot;But... before we can begin trying to sort something out,&quot; March says, &quot;It's time to address something that should have been addressed long ago.&quot;\n\nYou patiently wait to hear where he's going with this.\n\n&quot;Who. Among us. Is the traitor?&quot;\n\nYour stomach drops as you suddenly remember your dream. \n\n&quot;Traitor?&quot; Theo looks at each of you with sudden distrust. You notice that his eyes linger on you. You shiver again.\n\n&quot;Someone must have been tipped off about what was in the shipment and had it destroyed. But the only people who knew what was on the shipment other than Phil are here at the moment.&quot;\n\n&quot;So,&quot; he points a finger at each of you, &quot;The question was who?&quot;\n\nIt all seemed plausible. How convenient this accident was. It was obviously a sloppy cover-up proving that it was no mere coincidence. The fact that it wasn't a blatant foil in the plan meant that there must be someone on the inside. Before you all can come up with something else, you have to figure out who the traitor was and have them taken out before that information got leaked as well.\n\nLonnie glances at you out of the corner of his eye. &quot;Allison. Who is the traitor?&quot;\n\n[[The traitor is Lonnie]]\n[[The traitor is Chess]]\n[[The traitor is Madison]]\n[[The traitor is March]]\n[[The traitor is Theo]]\n[[The traitor is Phil]]\n[[The traitor is me]]</div></div></body></html>
